  "texte_original":"Chapter Twenty-Seven Ishmael (Isma'il) In this chapter, we discuss the eldest son of the Intimate Friend of the Most Merciful (Khalīl Ar-Raḥmān), who is Ishmael. I have mentioned during my discussion of Abraham the story of Hagar, that the King of Egypt gave her to Sarah, that Sarah presented her to Abraham, and that she bore Ishmael to him. I also mentioned what Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbās regarding the story of Abraham's arrival with Hagar and Ishmael in Makkah, the story of Zamzam, the upbringing of Ishmael, his learning of the Arabic language, his marriage to a woman from Jurhum, and then his divorce from her by the order of his father, the 'Khalil'. Then his marriage to another righteous woman from Jurhum, and his father's order to him to keep her and establish her. I also mentioned the story of Ishmael helping Abraham in building the Sacred House (the Kaaba). I have established the clear evidence that Ishmael is the one commanded to be sacrificed (Adh-Dhabīḥ), not Isaac, and that the description of Ishmael in the glad tidings of his birth was that of a 'forbearing boy' (*ghulām ḥalīm*), unlike the glad tidings of Isaac, who was described as a 'knowing boy' (*ghulām 'alīm*). And that Ishmael is older than Isaac, and that Abraham was not given the good news of Isaac until Ishmael had reached the age of walking and striving with his father (peace and blessings be upon them). I have also clarified that Allah placed among the descendants of Ishmael the Seal of the Prophets, the Master of the Messengers, the dazzling jewel, the radiant pearl, the one who holds the Praised Station (*Al-Maqām Al-Maḥmūd*) and the Visited Reservoir (*Al-Ḥawḍ Al-Mawrūd*), Muhammad. Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, mentioned Ishmael in His Noble Book in several places with magnificent descriptions, as He says in Sūrat Al-Baqarah: ﴿And [mention] when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House and [with him] Ishmael, [saying], 'Our Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing. Our Lord, and make us Muslims [in submission] to You and from our descendants a Muslim nation [in submission] to You. And show us our rites [of worship] and accept our repentance. Indeed, You are the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful'﴾ [Al-Baqarah: 127-128]. And He says in Sūrat Maryam: ﴿And mention in the Book Ishmael. Indeed, he was truthful in [his] promise, and he was a messenger and a prophet. And he used to enjoin on his people prayer and zakāh and was to his Lord acceptable.﴾ [Maryam: 54-55]. He also coupled him in the chain of Prophets and Messengers in places where He says: ﴿And remember Our servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob – those of capacity and vision. Indeed, We chose them for an exclusive quality: remembrance of the home [in the Hereafter]. And indeed, they are, in Our sight, among the chosen and outstanding. And mention Ishmael and Elisha and Dhū [al-] Kifl, and all were of the outstanding.﴾ [Ṣād: 45-48]. And Almighty says in Sūrat Al-Anbiyā': ﴿And Ishmael and Idrīs and Dhū [al-] Kifl; all were of the patient. And We admitted them into Our mercy. Indeed, they were of the righteous.﴾ [Al-Anbiyā': 85-86]. And Almighty says in Sūrat An-Nisā': ﴿Indeed, We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him. And We revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Descendants, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the book [of Psalms].﴾ [An-Nisā': 163]. And Almighty says in Sūrat Al-Baqarah: ﴿Say, [O believers], 'We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we are Muslims.'﴾ [Al-Baqarah: 136]. And Almighty says in Sūrat Āl 'Imrān: ﴿Say, 'We believe in Allah and in what was sent down to us and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants, and what was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we are Muslims.'﴾ [Āl 'Imrān: 84]. And He absolved Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants from [the claim of] Judaism and Christianity, as He says: ﴿Or are you saying that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants were Jews or Christians? Say, 'Are you more knowing or is Allah?' And who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do.﴾ [Al-Baqarah: 140]. Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, mentioned in His Noble Book a stature for Ishmael below which high ranks fall short, when his father, the 'Khalil', informed him that he saw in a dream that he was sacrificing him. Ishmael immediately submitted, recognizing that the vision of Prophets is a revelation to which one must hasten to obey and execute the command, even if it meant his sacrifice. He offered his very self in compliance with Allah's command and obedience to Allah's Messenger, and all of humanity has not known a station like this. In this regard, Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, says in Sūrat Aṣ-Ṣāffāt: ﴿And indeed, among his kind was Abraham, When he came to his Lord with a sound heart. When he said to his father and his people, 'What do you worship? Is it falsehood – [as] gods besides Allah – that you desire? Then what is your thought about the Lord of the worlds?' And he cast a glance at the stars And said, 'Indeed, I am sick.' So they turned away from him, retreating. Then he turned to their gods and said, 'Do you not eat? What is [wrong] with you that you do not speak?' And he turned upon them, striking [them] with [his] right hand. Then [the people] came toward him, hastening. He said, 'Do you worship that which you carve, While Allah created you and that which you do?' They said, 'Construct for him a furnace and throw him into the blazing fire.' So they intended a plot against him, but We made them the lowest. And [then] he said, 'Indeed, I am going to my Lord; He will guide me. My Lord, grant me [a child] from among the righteous.' So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy. And when he reached with him [the age of] striving, he said, 'O my son, indeed I have seen in a dream that I [must] sacrifice you, so look what you think.' He said, 'O my father, do what you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, of the patient.' And when they had both submitted [to the command of Allah] – meaning, they submitted to Allah's command – and he put him down upon his forehead – meaning, he laid him down on his forehead so that Allah's command could be carried out on him – ﴿We called to him, 'O Abraham, You have fulfilled the vision.'﴾ – meaning, you have fulfilled what Allah commanded you to do – ﴿Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good. Indeed, this was the clear trial. And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice.﴾ [Aṣ-Ṣāffāt: 83-107]. There is no dispute among genealogists that all the 'Adnāni Arab tribes are from the progeny of Ishmael. As for the Qaḥṭāni tribes, the majority of scholars hold that they are not from the progeny of Ishmael, and the general opinion of scholars is that Khuzā'ah is from Qaḥṭān, as are the Aws and the Khazraj. It is reported in Sahih Al-Bukhari from the hadith of Salama ibn Al-Akwa' (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) passed by a group from Aslam who were competing in archery—meaning, they were shooting arrows for a competition. He said: 'Shoot, O Sons of Ishmael, for your father was an archer, and I am with the son of so-and-so' (referring to one of the two teams). He said: 'One of the two teams held back their hands.' So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: 'What is wrong with you that you do not shoot?' They said: 'O Messenger of Allah, [how can we] while you are with them?' He said: 'Shoot, and I am with all of you.' In another wording by Al-Bukhari from the hadith of Salama (may Allah be pleased with him), he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) came out to a group from Aslam who were competing in archery in the market. He said: 'Shoot, O Sons of Ishmael, for your father was an archer, and I am with the sons of so-and-so' (to one of the two teams). They held back their hands. He said: 'What is wrong with them?' They said: 'How can we shoot while you are with the sons of so-and-so?' He said: 'Shoot, and I am with all of you.' The tribe of Aslam belongs to Aslam ibn Afṣā ibn Ḥāritha ibn 'Amr ibn 'Āmir of Khuzā'ah. This poses no problem for those who claim that Qaḥṭān is from the progeny of Ishmael. As for the majority of scholars who hold that the Qaḥṭāni tribes are not from the progeny of Ishmael, they say that this hadith may be interpreted as Aslam being from the progeny of Ishmael through the mothers, not the fathers, because the Qaḥṭāni and 'Adnāni tribes intermingled through marriage, and there is no objection to such an attribution, just as all the sons of Fāṭima Az-Zahrā' are attributed to the Messenger of Allah. Until the next chapter, if Allah wills, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.",

  "texte_original":"Moses. We speak to you about the great Prophet of the Children of Israel, one of the Messengers of firm resolve, the one who spoke directly with God (Kalīm Allāh), Moses son of 'Imran, peace be upon him. 'Imran, the father of Moses, was from the lineage of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, peace be upon them. He is not the 'Imran mentioned in Sūrah Āl 'Imrān (The Family of 'Imran), which is named after him, where God (Exalted is He) says: {Indeed, Allah chose Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of 'Imran over the worlds.} [Āl 'Imrān: 33]. That 'Imran is the father of Maryam (Mary), the mother of Jesus. God (Exalted is He) clarified this immediately after this verse, saying: {Descendants, one of the other; and Allah is Hearing and Knowing. [Mention] when the wife of 'Imran said, 'My Lord, indeed I have vowed to You what is in my womb, dedicated [to Your service], so accept this from me. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing.' But when she delivered her, she said, 'My Lord, indeed I have delivered a female.' And Allah was most knowing of what she delivered. 'And the male is not like the female. And I have named her Maryam, and I seek refuge for her in You and [for] her descendants from Satan, the expelled [from God's mercy].'} [Āl 'Imrān: 34-36]. Nearly two thousand years separate 'Imran, the father of Moses, and 'Imran, the father of Maryam. Allah (Blessed and Exalted is He) alluded to the situation prevalent in Egypt at the time of Moses' birth, as the oppression and tyranny of Pharaoh against the Children of Israel and his corruption on Earth had reached the utmost limits of arrogance. He had divided its people into factions, favoring some and oppressing others, namely the Children of Israel. He was slaying their sons and letting their women live, employing those who were oppressed in humiliation, various forms of degradation, and torment. Allah (Exalted is He) intended to confer favor upon those who had been oppressed on Earth among the Children of Israel, who were at that time confined in Egypt, to make them leaders of guidance, to grant them security, to establish them firmly in the land, and to make them the inheritors, while replacing their fear with safety. Hatred and resentment toward the Children of Israel had ignited in the hearts of Pharaoh, Haman, and their armies because of the premonition instilled in their minds that the end of their dominion and their destruction would occur at the hands of a man from the Children of Israel. Yet, caution cannot avert fate. Allah (Exalted is He) willed to show Pharaoh, Haman, and their armies from them what they were apprehensive of. [Al-Qasas: 6]. Thus, Moses was born in this suffocating atmosphere. His mother feared that Pharaoh would kill him, as Moses' birth coincided with one of the periods when Pharaoh carried out the slaughter of the male infants of the Children of Israel. So, Allah (Almighty) inspired Moses' mother: \"Suckle him; but when you fear for him from Pharaoh killing him, fashion a solid box for him like a boat, place him in the box, and cast him into the Nile River. Banish fear from yourself, so neither fear nor grieve, for Allah (Exalted is He) will preserve him for you, return him to you, and your son will be one of the Messengers. \" Some scholars said that the revelation here means an inspiration or a dream. I say there is no impediment to Allah (Blessed and Exalted is He) having sent an angel to her with this revelation, and that she believed in him and affirmed His promise. The angel's arrival with this advice does not necessitate that she was a prophetess. It is established in the two authentic collections of Al-Bukhārī and Muslim, from the Hadīth of Abū Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: \"Allah wished to test three men from the Children of Israel: a leper, a bald man, and a blind man. So He sent an angel to them. The angel came to the leper and asked, 'What thing is most beloved to you?' He replied, 'A beautiful color and beautiful skin, and that the defect which has made people shun me be removed.' The angel wiped him, and his defect disappeared, and he was given a beautiful color. The angel then asked, 'What wealth is most beloved to you?' He replied, 'Camels,' or he said, 'Cows,' (the narrator was in doubt). He was given a pregnant she-camel, and the angel said, 'May Allah bless it for you.' Then he came to the bald man and asked, 'What thing is most beloved to you?' He replied, 'Beautiful hair, and that the defect which has made people shun me be removed.' The angel wiped him, and his defect disappeared, and he was given beautiful hair. The angel then asked, 'What wealth is most beloved to you?' He replied, 'Cows.' He was given a pregnant cow, and the angel said, 'May Allah bless it for you.' Then he came to the blind man and asked, 'What thing is most beloved to you?' He replied, 'That Allah restore my sight so I can see people.' The angel wiped him, and Allah restored his sight to him. The angel then asked, 'What wealth is most beloved to you?' He replied, 'Sheep.' He was given a lamb that had just given birth. The first two produced offspring, and the third one also gave birth. Thus, one had a valley of camels, another a valley of cows, and the third a valley of sheep. Then the angel came to the leper in his former appearance and condition. He said, 'I am a poor man whose means have been cut off during my journey, and I have no means of reaching my destination today except by God and then by you. I ask you, by the One Who gave you the beautiful color, the beautiful skin, and the wealth, a camel to help me in my journey.' He replied, 'The rights [upon this wealth] are many.' The angel said, 'I think I know you. Were you not a leper whom people shunned, and poor, and then Allah gave you [this]?' He replied, 'I inherited this wealth from my forefathers, generation after generation.' The angel said, 'If you are lying, may Allah turn you back to what you were.' Then he came to the bald man in his former appearance and condition, and said to him the same as he said to the first, and the man replied with the same answer. The angel said, 'If you are lying, may Allah turn you back to what you were.' Then he came to the blind man in his former appearance and condition. He said, 'I am a poor man and a traveler whose means have been cut off during my journey, and I have no means of reaching my destination today except by God and then by you. I ask you, by the One Who restored your sight to you, a sheep to help me in my journey.' The man said, 'I was blind, and Allah restored my sight to me. So take whatever you wish and leave whatever you wish. By Allah, I will not burden you today by demanding anything you take for the sake of Allah.' The angel said, 'Keep your wealth. You were merely being tested. Allah is pleased with you and displeased with your two companions.' This authentic Hadīth, agreed upon, proves that God may send an angel to one of His servants who is neither a Prophet nor a Messenger. Similarly, Muslim narrated in his Sahīh, from the Hadīth of Abū Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"A man set out to visit a brother of his in another village. Allah (Almighty) stationed an angel on his path. When the angel came to him, he asked, 'Where are you going?' He replied, 'I intend to visit a brother of mine in this village.' The angel asked, 'Do you have a favor that you want to gain from him?' He replied, 'No, except that I love him for the sake of Allah (Almighty).' The angel said, 'Then I am a messenger of Allah to you [to inform you] that Allah loves you as you have loved him for His sake.' This proves that Allah (Almighty) may send an angel to some people and address them without them being Prophets. Allah (Almighty) also sent angels to Maryam (Mary), as He says: {And [mention] when the angels said, 'O Maryam, indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds. O Maryam, be devoutly obedient to your Lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow [in prayer].'} [Āl 'Imrān: 42-43]. Then He (Almighty) says: { [Mention] when the angels said, 'O Maryam, indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a word from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Maryam - distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among the nearest [to Allah]. He will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be of the righteous.'} [Āl 'Imrān: 45-46]. Maryam was not a prophetess, but a righteous, truthful woman from the devout ones. Regarding the birth of Moses, the description of the atmosphere in which he was born, Pharaoh's tyranny, his humiliation of the Children of Israel, and the inspiration to Moses' mother to cast him into the river with the promise of his return to her, Allah says: {We recite to you from the news of Moses and Pharaoh in truth for a people who believe. Indeed, Pharaoh was haughty in the land and made its people into factions, oppressing a sector among them, slaughtering their [male] sons and letting their women live. Indeed, he was of the corrupters. But We wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them the inheritors. And establish them in the land and show Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers through them that which they had been fearing. And We inspired to the mother of Moses, 'Suckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and make him one of the Messengers.'} [Al-Qasas: 3-7]. And until the next chapter, God willing. Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of Allah. Chapter Forty-Five: Moses Continued 190. At the end of the previous chapter, I mentioned what Allah (Exalted is He) recounted about the birth of Moses and the inspiration of Allah (Almighty) to his mother: {Suckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and make him one of the Messengers.} [Al-Qasas: 7]. This revelation included two commands, two prohibitions, and two pieces of news. Allah (Blessed and Exalted is He) summarized this in Sūrah Ṭā-Hā, where He mentions His favor upon Moses, saying: {And We had already conferred favor upon you another time, when We inspired to your mother what was inspired} [Ṭā-Hā: 37-38], then He detailed that summarized revelation, saying: { 'Put him into the chest and cast it into the river, and the river will throw it onto the bank; an enemy to Me and an enemy to him will take him.' And I bestowed upon you love from Me that you might be brought up under My eye.} [Ṭā-Hā: 39]. Moses' mother did as Allah (Almighty) commanded her. She cast her child into the river after placing him in the chest (the Ark). Allah (Blessed and Exalted is He) mentioned that the river cast the chest containing Moses onto the bank, which is the river's shore, in front of the house of Pharaoh's family. {Then the family of Pharaoh picked him up} [Al-Qasas: 8]. They rejoiced in him because of the love that Allah had cast upon Moses in the heart of anyone who saw him. However, Pharaoh feared that he might be from the Children of Israel and considered killing him. His wife, Asiya, said: { 'Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son.'} [Al-Qasas: 9]. They were unaware that they were picking up the one at whose hands their kingdom would be destroyed, and who would be an enemy and a sorrow for them. Thus, Allah ordained for him that his fiercest enemy should raise him, and that he should grow up in their house, just as the poet said: \"And if Providence watches you with its eyes, sleep, for all fears are security. \" Allah (Almighty) prepared for him the righteous woman Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh, the enemy of Allah and His Messengers, to oversee his upbringing. However, Allah (Exalted is He) prevented him from taking the breast of any woman other than his mother. Whenever they brought him a wet nurse, he refused to suckle from her breast. The condition of Moses' mother, with the intensity of her contained fear for him, reached a point where her heart became empty (of all but fear), as if she was about to disclose [her secret], had not Allah strengthened her heart, so that she would be among the believers. She told his sister to follow his trail and see what those who had picked him up would do with him, and to be careful not to let them know that she was his sister or that she was trying to find out anything about him. She was to look from a distance and in an oblique manner that would not reveal her preoccupation with him. His sister carried out her mother's instruction. They passed by her while searching for a wet nurse for him. She said, \"I will guide you to a wet nurse whom he may accept. \" So, they brought him to his mother, and he took her breast, and they rejoiced greatly. They began to take him back and forth to her. Her eye was comforted by him, and Allah (Almighty) relieved her of her grief over him. She learned that the promise of Allah was true, and that Allah is capable of all things, and that when He wills a matter, He prepares the means for it and removes the obstacles. Moses continued to live in Pharaoh's house as if he were their own child, surrounded by their affection, until he reached his full strength and maturity. Allah filled his heart with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge. In this is the strengthening of the heart of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the believers, and that Allah (Almighty) grants victory to His allies, delivers them from tribulations, and saves them from harm. Concerning all of this, Allah (Blessed and Exalted is He) says in Sūrah Al-Qasas: {Then the family of Pharaoh picked him up [to be] to them an enemy and a grief. Indeed, Pharaoh, Haman and their soldiers were wrongdoers. And the wife of Pharaoh said, '[He will be] a comfort of the eye for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son.' And they perceived not. And the heart of Moses' mother became empty [of all else]. She was about to disclose [the matter] concerning him had not We made [her heart] firm, that she might be among the believers. And she said to his sister, 'Follow him.' So she watched him from a distance while they perceived not. And We had prevented from him [all] wet nurses before, so she said, 'Shall I direct you to the people of a household who will be responsible for him for you while they are to him [internally] sincere?' So We restored him to his mother that her eyes might be comforted and that she might not grieve and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of them do not know. And when he attained his full strength and was [mentally] mature, We gave him judgment and knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good.} [Al-Qasas: 8-14]. And He (Almighty) says in Sūrah Ṭā-Hā: {When your sister went and said, 'Shall I direct you to one who will take care of him?' So We restored you to your mother that her eyes might be comforted and she might not grieve.} [Ṭā-Hā: 40]. In the saying of Allah (Almighty): {Then the family of Pharaoh picked him up [to be] to them an enemy and a grief}, the Lām in {to be to them an enemy and a grief} is the Lām of consequence. That is, they did not realize that the consequence of their picking him up would be for him to become an enemy and a grief to them. How often does a person perform an action for a certain purpose, only for its consequence to be the opposite of what he intended, because the entire matter belongs solely to Allah. The human, no matter how much he claims power and knowledge, is ignorant of the consequence of his affair. Haman was Pharaoh's minister (may Allah curse them both). Regarding Moses' upbringing in Pharaoh's house, Allah (Almighty) says in Sūrah Ash-Shu'arā (The Poets): { [Pharaoh] said, 'Did we not raise you among us as a child, and did you remain among us for years of your life?'} [Ash-Shu'arā: 18]. After Moses reached his full strength, maturity, and his intellect became complete, and Allah (Almighty) bestowed upon him wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, Allah intended to bring about an event at his hands that would prompt him to leave Egypt, flee from Pharaoh's family, and distance himself from their customs and traditions. Allah destined him to enter the center of the city at a moment of its people's inattention, either during their sleep or when they were occupied with their games and amusements, where the roads were almost empty of passersby. He found two men fighting, each seeking to harm the other. Moses knew that one was an Israelite and the other a Copt. It seemed to him that the Copt was stronger than the Israelite, and that is why the Israelite implored him and asked for his help. Moses (Exalted is He) intended to push the Copt away from the Israelite, so he struck him with his hand and shoved him with his clenched fist to repel him. Moses did not know that this single blow would kill him. Therefore, he felt intense remorse and attributed this evil to Satan, saying: { 'This is from the work of Satan. Indeed, he is a clear, misleading enemy.' He said, 'My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me,' and He forgave him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.} [Al-Qasas: 15-16]. He resolved not to return to such an act and said: { 'My Lord, for the favor which You bestowed upon me, I will never be an ally to the criminals.'} [Al-Qasas: 17], meaning, a supporter of any criminal disbeliever. He then spent the morning {in the city, fearful and anticipating} [Al-Qasas: 18] what the killing of this Copt would lead to, and whether they would realize it was Moses and apprehend him for it. While he was thus on a road near the place where the Copt was killed, the same Israelite he had helped yesterday was calling out to him (imploring and asking for his aid) against another Copt. Moses (Exalted is He) responded to him by saying, \"Indeed, you are clearly misguided [and a source of trouble]. \" [Al-Qasas: 19]. When Moses gestured with his hand toward the Israelite, a gesture of anger, rebuking him for his bad behavior, the Israelite said: { 'O Moses, do you intend to kill me as you killed a soul yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the reformers.'} [Al-Qasas: 19]. Moses then knew that the news would inevitably reach Pharaoh from this Copt, and that they would surely kill him. Indeed, the Copt informed Pharaoh's family that Moses was the one who had killed the Copt the day before, and they plotted to kill Moses. And until the next chapter, God willing. Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of Allah. Chapter Forty-Six: Moses Continued 199. I mentioned at the end of the previous chapter that the Copt informed Pharaoh's family that Moses was the one who killed the Copt, and that they plotted against him. Moses felt great grief, a severe trial, and an intense affliction. Allah (Almighty) disposed for Moses a man whose house was near Pharaoh's family, living with them in the outskirts of the city—as was the custom in ancient and modern times for the elite to reside in the outlying areas. This man knew their news and had a strong affection for Moses. He rushed to search for Moses until he found him inside the city, and he informed him that Pharaoh's notables were conspiring against Moses to kill him. He commanded him to quickly flee from Egypt to escape their evil and be saved from their plot. He explained that his motive for this was his love and sincere advice for him. Moses quickly left, heading towards Sinai, invoking his Lord to save him from the unjust people who were deciding to kill someone who did not deserve to be killed. He (Exalted is He) resolved to proceed {towards Madyan}, but he was unfamiliar with the route. He earnestly supplicated to Allah (Almighty) to guide him to its path, to grant him success in taking the intended road, and to direct him to the straight path. He continued his journey until he {arrived at the water of Madyan}, where he found a group of people watering their livestock. He found before this group of waterers two women holding back their sheep from the water, even though Moses saw the sheep in need of water. Moses asked the two women: { 'What is your circumstance?'} Why are you holding back your sheep from the water when they need it? {They said, 'We do not water until the shepherds depart; and our father is an old man who is very old'} and cannot attend to watering our sheep. Moses stepped forward and watered for them without asking for any payment. After watering their sheep, he withdrew to the shade of a nearby tree, sat under it, and secretly addressed his Lord: {He said, 'My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need.'} [Al-Qasas: 24]. Then one of the two women came to him, with shyness apparent on her face and in her walk. {She said, 'Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us.'} [Al-Qasas: 25] and recompense this kindness with kindness. When Moses came to the old man and recounted to him his story with Pharaoh's family, {the old man said, 'Fear not. You have escaped from the unjust people.'} [Al-Qasas: 25]. One of the two women then asked her father to hire Moses to tend their sheep. She informed her father that he was the best to hire because he was strong and trustworthy, embodying the most important, best, and most reliable qualities of an employee. She seemed to have known this from observing him while he was watering the sheep, along with his lowered gaze and good demeanor. The old man said: { 'Indeed, I wish to wed you to one of these two daughters of mine on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years. But if you complete ten, it will be [as a favor] from you, and I do not want to make hardship for you. You will find me, if Allah wills, to be of the righteous.'} [Al-Qasas: 27]. Moses agreed to marry one of the two women, with the dowry being service for eight years, to be completed as ten if he wished. Undoubtedly, this was a high dowry, but it was part of Allah's wisdom and His preparation of Moses, so that this term would be the remaining period until Allah would send him as a Messenger, complete His favor upon him, and he would come to Mount Tur at the appointed time. Allah (Exalted is He) alludes to all of this in Sūrah Ṭā-Hā, clarifying the grief and sorrow that befell Moses after the killing of the Copt, the Israelite's call for help the next day, and his flight to the land of Madyan and his stay there as long as Allah willed, saying: {And you killed a soul, but We saved you from the distress, and We tried you with successive trials. And you remained some years among the people of Madyan. Then you came [here] at the decreed time, O Moses. And I produced you for Myself.} [Ṭā-Hā: 40-41]. And Allah (Exalted is He) says in Sūrah Al-Qasas: {And he entered the city at a time of [near] inattention by its people and found therein two men fighting: one from his faction and one from among his enemies. And the one from his faction called to him for help against the one from his enemy, so Moses struck him with his fist and eliminated him. [Moses] said, 'This is from the work of Satan. Indeed, he is a clear, misleading enemy.' He said, 'My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me,' and He forgave him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. He said, 'My Lord, for the favor which You bestowed upon me, I will never be an ally to the criminals.' And he spent the morning in the city, fearful and anticipating [what might happen]. And suddenly the one who had sought his help the previous day cried out to him [again]. Moses said to him, 'Indeed, you are clearly misguided.' And when he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them, [the Israelite] said, 'O Moses, do you intend to kill me as you killed a soul yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the reformers.' And a man came running from the farthest end of the city. He said, 'O Moses, indeed the assembly is conspiring against you to kill you, so depart; indeed, I am to you of the sincere advisors.' So he left it, fearful and anticipating [apprehension]. He said, 'My Lord, save me from the unjust people.' And when he directed his face toward Madyan, he said, 'Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right path.' And when he came to the water of Madyan, he found there a crowd of people watering [their flocks], and he found aside from them two women keeping back [their flocks]. He said, 'What is your circumstance?' They said, 'We do not water until the shepherds depart; and our father is an old man who is very old.' So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the shade and said, 'My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need.' Then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness. She said, 'Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us.' So when he came to him and related to him the story, the old man said, 'Fear not. You have escaped from the unjust people.' One of [the women] said, 'O my father, hire him. Indeed, the best of those you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy.' He said, 'Indeed, I wish to wed you to one of these two daughters of mine on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years. But if you complete ten, it will be [as a favor] from you, and I do not want to make hardship for you. You will find me, if Allah wills, to be of the righteous.' [Moses] said, 'That is [established] between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete, there is to be no injustice to me, and Allah is over what we say a Witness.'} [Al-Qasas: 15-28]. I mentioned in the story of Shu'ayb (Jethro) that he was not Moses' father-in-law, and that the old man who married his daughter to Moses in Madyan was a righteous man from the remnants of those who believed in Shu'ayb. I mentioned what indicates this from the Book of Allah (Blessed and Exalted is He) in this context. As for the Hadīth of Al-Futūn (The Trials) which is famous among people, and which An-Nasā'ī mentioned in the book of Tafsīr (Exegesis) from his Sunan, which includes the detailed story of Moses from beginning to end, An-Nasā'ī reported it, saying: \"'Abdullāh ibn Muhammad narrated to us, Yazīd ibn Hārūn narrated to us, Asbagh ibn Zayd narrated to us, Al-Qāsim ibn Abī Ayyūb informed me, Sa'īd ibn Jubayr said: I asked 'Abdullāh ibn 'Abbās about the saying of Allah (Almighty) to Moses: {and We tried you with successive trials} [Ṭā-Hā: 40], and I asked him about what Al-Futūn were. He said: 'Wait until morning, O son of Jubayr, for it is a long narrative.' When morning came, I went to Ibn 'Abbās to fulfill the promise he had made regarding the Hadīth of Al-Futūn. He then narrated the Hadīth. Ibn Kathīr said in his history after narrating it: \"Thus, Imam An-Nasā'ī narrated this Hadīth, and Ibn Jarīr and Ibn Abī Ḥātim also extracted it in their Tafsīr from the Hadīth of Yazīd ibn Hārūn. The most probable, and Allah knows best, is that it is Mawqūf (attributed to a Companion), and its being Marfū' (attributed to the Prophet) is questionable. Most of it is derived from the Isrā'īliyyāt (narratives from the People of the Book). \" Then he said: \"And there is doubt and oddity in some of what is in it. It is most likely from the speech of Ka'b Al-Ahbār, and I heard our Shaykh, Al-Ḥāfiz Abul-Ḥajjāj Al-Mizzī, say that. And Allah knows best. \" And until the next chapter, God willing. Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of Allah. Chapter Forty-Seven: Moses Continued After Moses had completed the term he was obligated to, and fulfilled it in the most perfect manner, Allah inspired him to head with his family towards Egypt. He did not know that the decrees of bliss awaited him on the way, and that Allah (Exalted is He) would call him, speak to him, and converse secretly with him in the Sacred Valley of Ṭuwā. He traveled with his family and a flock of sheep, heading towards the land of Egypt. During his journey, a cold wind passed over them on a dark night, preventing them from continuing, as the cold intensified and he did not know the direction of the road. Suddenly, a fire appeared to him near which he saw a tree. He felt familiarity and joy because of this. He said to his family: { 'Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire.'} [Ṭā-Hā: 10]. I will go to it. Perhaps I will find someone there who can guide us to the straight path, or I will bring you a piece of the fire so that you may warm yourselves with it. It is evident that his wife did not see this fire, and that the fire was only manifested to Moses alone. It also appears that Moses did not know the name of the place where he saw the fire, nor did he realize that it was the Sacred Valley of Ṭuwā, and that he would find the greatest guidance there. As soon as Moses approached the fire, with his staff in his hand, {he was called from the bank of the valley on the right side} [Al-Qasas: 30], meaning from the side of the valley next to the mountain, on his right side, from the western direction, {in the blessed spot, from the tree} [Al-Qasas: 30]: { 'Blessed is He who is in the fire and [all] around it. And exalted is Allah, Lord of the worlds.'} [An-Naml: 8]. { 'Remove your sandals; indeed, you are in the sacred valley of Ṭuwā.'} [Ṭā-Hā: 12]. { 'O Moses, indeed it is I - Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.'} [An-Naml: 9]. { 'Indeed, I am Allah; there is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance. Indeed, the Hour is coming - I nearly conceal it - so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives. So do not let whoever does not believe in it and follows his desire avert you from it, and you [thus] perish.'} [Ṭā-Hā: 14-16]. After Allah crowned Moses with the decrees of bliss, He, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware, asked him about what was in his hand, to give him comfort and to strengthen his heart, and to show him a miracle that would indicate that Allah (Almighty) would support him, give him victory, and grant the favorable outcome to him and to those who believed in him. He said to him: { 'And what is that in your right hand, O Moses?' He said, 'It is my staff.'} [Ṭā-Hā: 17-18]. Moses did not stop at this answer, but began to explain some of the benefits of his staff, to prolong the pleasure of the intimate conversation. He said: { 'I lean upon it, and I bring down leaves with it for my sheep.'} [Ṭā-Hā: 18]. Then he said: { 'And I have therein other uses.'} [Ṭā-Hā: 18]. Perhaps he hoped that He would ask him about these other purposes and intentions, thus increasing the pleasure and prolonging the intimate conversation. The lover desires that the voice of his Beloved should never cease, as the poet said: \"And there is no good except hearing your speech, face-to-face, dictated to me, and I convey it. \" And as another poet said: \"And when I came to visit Sa'dā, among the modest white women, her companion wished, I saw the earth folded for me and the distant drew near, if only a finished story would be repeated. \" And to Allah belongs the highest example. Allah (Exalted is He) commanded him to throw the staff on the ground. He threw it, and behold, {it was a serpent, moving rapidly} [Ṭā-Hā: 20] and moving on its belly with great speed, like a small snake. When Moses saw it trembling and moving quickly, he turned and fled without looking back due to intense fear. Then Allah called him: { 'O Moses, do not fear. Indeed, in My presence the messengers do not fear.} [An-Naml: 10]. And He said to him: { 'Seize it and do not fear. We will return it to its former state.'} [Ṭā-Hā: 21]. So he took it, and it returned to being a staff in his hand as it was the first time. Then Allah (Exalted is He) commanded him to insert his hand into his bosom, meaning the opening of his garment. He inserted it, and when he withdrew it, behold, it was white without any leprosy or sickness, even though Moses was dark-skinned (adam). This was another sign. Allah (Exalted is He) commanded him to go to Pharaoh the tyrant, who said to his people: { 'I am your Lord, the Most High.'} [An-Nāzi'āt: 24]. He was to demand from him and his people the sincere worship of Allah alone, and that he should release the Children of Israel to him and deliver them from the humiliating torment. He asked him to be gentle in inviting Pharaoh to Allah and to speak to him: { 'a gentle word; perhaps he may be reminded or fear.'} [Ṭā-Hā: 44]. Moses then asked his Lord to expand his breast, ease his affair, and untie a knot from his tongue so that they might understand his speech, and to send his brother Aaron with him to strengthen his resolve and share in his mission, because Aaron son of 'Imran was known for his eloquence among his people. Allah (Exalted is He) granted him all of that and explained to him that Allah's favor upon him was great, and that this was not the first favor. He reminded him of another favor at his birth, when He inspired his mother to cast him into the river for Pharaoh's family to pick him up and raise him in the lap of his enemy, who protected and cared for him, even though he was constantly slaying the sons of the Children of Israel. Moses mentioned that he feared Pharaoh might kill him for the Copt's death, so Allah reassured him and informed him that He would grant them authority so that Pharaoh would not be able to kill him. He said to him: { 'Fear not. Indeed, I am with you both; I hear and I see. So go to him and say, 'Indeed, we are the messengers of your Lord, so send with us the Children of Israel and do not torment them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord, and peace will be upon whoever follows the guidance.'} [Ṭā-Hā: 46-47]. Allah (Blessed and Exalted is He) described Moses' arrival at the Sacred Valley of Ṭuwā, specified the place where the intimate conversation took place, and mentioned what Moses secretly said in various places in the Great Qur'an to strengthen the heart of the Messenger of Allah Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and to be a clear sign to the Arabs and non-Arabs that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Neither the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) nor any of his people knew these accurate and truthful accounts. He was the illiterate among the illiterate people. Muhammad was not on the western side when Allah decreed the matter to Moses, nor was he among the witnesses. Nor was he on the side of the Mount when Moses was called. But it is a mercy from Allah for the bearer of good tidings and the warner, and for those who believe in him until the Day of Resurrection. Concerning this, Allah (Blessed and Exalted is He) says in Sūrah Maryam (Mary): {And mention in the Book, Moses. Indeed, he was chosen, and he was a messenger and a prophet. And We called him from the side of the mount's right and brought him near in [private] conversation. And We bestowed upon him through Our mercy his brother Aaron as a prophet.} [Maryam: 51-53]. And He (Exalted is He) says in Sūrah Ṭā-Hā: {And has the story of Moses reached you? When he saw a fire and said to his family, 'Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire; perhaps I can bring you from it a burning ember or find at the fire some guidance.' And when he came to it, he was called, 'O Moses, Indeed, I am your Lord, so remove your sandals. Indeed, you are in the sacred valley of Ṭuwā. And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed [to you]. Indeed, I am Allah; there is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance. Indeed, the Hour is coming - I nearly conceal it - so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives. So do not let whoever does not believe in it and follows his desire avert you from it, and you [thus] perish. And what is that in your right hand, O Moses?' He said, 'It is my staff; I lean upon it, and I bring down leaves with it for my sheep, and I have therein other uses.' [Allah] said, 'Throw it down, O Moses.' So he threw it down, and thereupon it was a serpent, moving rapidly. [Allah] said, 'Seize it and do not fear. We will return it to its former state. And draw in your hand to your side; it will emerge white without disability - [that is] another sign - that We may show you [some] of Our greater signs. Go to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed.' [Moses] said, 'My Lord, expand for me my breast [with assurance], and ease for me my task, and untie the knot from my tongue that they may understand my speech. And appoint for me a minister from my family - Aaron, my brother. Increase thereby my strength and let him share my task that we may praise You much and remember You much. Indeed, You are of us ever Seeing.' [Allah] said, 'You have been granted your request, O Moses. And We had already conferred favor upon you another time'} [Ṭā-Hā: 9-37]. And until the next chapter, God willing. Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of Allah. Chapter Forty-Eight: Moses Continued 207. In this chapter, we continue what Allah (Exalted is He) mentioned in Sūrah Ṭā-Hā regarding the story of Moses' arrival at the Sacred Valley of Ṭuwā, Allah's intimate conversation with him, and His favor upon him, where He says: {And We had already conferred favor upon you another time, when We inspired to your mother what was inspired: 'Put him into the chest and cast it into the river, and the river will throw it onto the bank; an enemy to Me and an enemy to him will take him.' And I bestowed upon you love from Me that you might be brought up under My eye. When your sister went and said, 'Shall I direct you to one who will take care of him?' So We restored you to your mother that her eyes might be comforted and she might not grieve. And you killed a soul, but We saved you from the distress, and We tried you with successive trials. And you remained some years among the people of Madyan. Then you came [here] at the decreed time, O Moses. And I produced you for Myself. Go, you and your brother, with My signs and do not slacken in My remembrance. Go to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed. And speak to him with gentle speech that perhaps he may be reminded or fear.' They said, 'Our Lord, indeed we fear that he may hasten [punishment] upon us or that he may transgress.' He said, 'Fear not. Indeed, I am with you both; I hear and I see. So go to him and say, 'Indeed, we are the messengers of your Lord, so send with us the Children of Israel and do not torment them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord, and peace will be upon whoever follows the guidance. Indeed, it has been revealed to us that the punishment will be upon whoever denies and turns away.'} [Ṭā-Hā: 37-48]. And He (Exalted is He) says in Sūrah Ash-Shu'arā (The Poets): {And [mention] when your Lord called Moses, [saying], 'Go to the wrongdoing people - The people of Pharaoh; will they not fear Allah?' He said, 'My Lord, indeed I fear that they will deny me, and that my breast will tighten and my tongue will not be fluent, so send [a messenger] to Aaron. And they have against me a [claim of] sin, so I fear that they will kill me.' [Allah] said, 'No, never! Go both of you with Our signs; indeed, We are with you, listening. Go to Pharaoh and say, 'We are the messenger of the Lord of the worlds, [commanding] that you send with us the Children of Israel.'} [Ash-Shu'arā: 10-17]. And He (Exalted is He) says in Sūrah An-Naml (The Ants): { [Mention] when Moses said to his family, 'Indeed, I have perceived a fire. I will bring you from there an account or bring you a burning branch so that you may warm yourselves.' But when he came to it, he was called, 'Blessed is He who is in the fire and [all] around it. And exalted is Allah, Lord of the worlds. O Moses, indeed it is I - Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. And throw down your staff!' But when he saw it writhing as if it were a serpent, he turned in flight and did not return. [Allah said], 'O Moses, fear not. Indeed, in My presence the messengers do not fear. Except one who has wronged and then substituted good after evil, for indeed, I am Forgiving and Merciful. And put your hand into the opening of your garment; it will exit white without disability [as a sign] among nine signs [going] to Pharaoh and his people. Indeed, they have been a defiantly disobedient people.'} [An-Naml: 7-12]. And He (Almighty) says in Sūrah Al-Qasas: {And when Moses had completed the term and was traveling with his family, he perceived from the direction of Mount Ṭūr a fire. He said to his family, 'Remain [here]; indeed, I have perceived a fire; perhaps I will bring you from there information or a burning branch of fire that you may warm yourselves.' But when he came to it, he was called from the bank of the valley on the right side in the blessed spot, from the tree, 'O Moses, indeed it is I - Allah, Lord of the worlds.' And [he was told], 'Throw down your staff.' But when he saw it movement as if it were a serpent, he turned in flight and did not return. [Allah said], 'O Moses, approach and fear not. Indeed, you are of the secure. Insert your hand into the opening of your garment; it will come out white without disability, and draw in your arm to yourself [to guard] against fear. These two are proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his establishment. Indeed, they have been a defiantly disobedient people.' He said, 'My Lord, indeed I killed from among them a soul, and I fear that they will kill me. And my brother Aaron is more eloquent than me in speech, so send him with me as a helper to confirm me. Indeed, I fear that they will deny me.' [Allah] said, 'We will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you. [It will be] by Our signs; you two and those who follow you will be the predominant.'} [Al-Qasas: 29-35]. And He says in Sūrah An-Nāzi'āt (Those Who Drag Forth): {Has there come to you the story of Moses? When his Lord called to him in the sacred valley of Ṭuwā, 'Go to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed. And say to him, 'Would you [like to] purify yourself, and that I guide you to your Lord so you would fear [Him]?'} [An-Nāzi'āt: 15-19]. And His saying (Exalted is He): {Then you came [here] at the decreed time, O Moses.} [Ṭā-Hā: 40]. That is, your journey from the land of Madyan to the land of Egypt so that your Lord could call you and converse secretly with you in the Sacred Valley was a predestined matter decreed by Allah. He moved you, directed you, and inspired you to seek refuge in the blessed spot according to what Allah had decreed in eternity and predestined before the creation of the heavens and the earth. Everything with Him is by measure. And He is {Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Grand, the Exalted.} [Ar-Ra'd: 9]. And His saying (Exalted is He): {Except one who has wronged and then substituted good after evil, for indeed, I am Forgiving and Merciful} [An-Naml: 11]. The exception here is disjunctive, meaning 'but,' and the sentence is parenthetical to explain the favor of Allah (Almighty) upon His creation, and that He overlooks evil deeds and forgives {whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then is [rightly] guided.} [Ṭā-Hā: 82]. It is not permissible for anyone to despair of the mercy of Allah, {Indeed, no one despairs of relief from Allah except the disbelieving people.} [Yūsuf: 87]. Regarding His saying (Exalted is He): {And We called him from the side of the mount's right and brought him near in [private] conversation.} [Maryam: 52]. And His saying (Exalted is He): {But when he came to it, he was called, 'O Moses!'} [Ṭā-Hā: 11]. And His saying (Exalted is He): {And [mention] when your Lord called Moses} [Ash-Shu'arā: 10]. And His saying (Exalted is He): {But when he came to it, he was called, 'Blessed is He who is in the fire and [all] around it. And exalted is Allah, Lord of the worlds. O Moses, indeed it is I - Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.'} [An-Naml: 8-9]. And His saying (Exalted is He): {But when he came to it, he was called from the bank of the valley on the right side in the blessed spot, from the tree, 'O Moses, indeed it is I - Allah, Lord of the worlds.'} [Al-Qasas: 30]. And His saying (Exalted is He): {When his Lord called to him in the sacred valley of Ṭuwā} [An-Nāzi'āt: 16]. And His saying (Exalted is He): {And Allah spoke to Moses with [direct] speech.} [An-Nisā': 164]. And His saying (Exalted is He): {Those messengers - some of them We caused to exceed others. Among them were those to whom Allah spoke} [Al-Baqarah: 253]. In these blessed verses, there is conclusive proof of affirming the attribute of Speech for Allah (Exalted is He), and that He speaks whenever He wills and however He wills, and that Allah (Exalted is He) made Moses His interlocutor (Kalīm) just as He made Abraham and Muhammad His intimate friends (Khalīl). And His saying (Exalted is He): {in the blessed spot, from the tree} [Al-Qasas: 30]. That is, the call came from the blessed spot, from near the tree, just as you say, \"I heard Zayd's speech from the house. \" Your saying \"from the house \" indicates the beginning of the boundary, not that the house is the speaker. Likewise, the tree is not the speaker; rather, Moses heard the speech of Allah from near the tree, for the tree is not the one saying: {O Moses, indeed it is I - Allah} [Al-Qasas: 30], but the one who said that is the Lord of the worlds. And His saying: {indeed we fear that he may hasten [punishment] upon us or that he may transgress} [Ṭā-Hā: 45]. The meaning of {that he may hasten [punishment] upon us} is that he may hasten our punishment before hearing our speech. And His saying (Exalted is He): {And when Moses had completed the term} [Al-Qasas: 29]. That is, he finished it, executed it, and fulfilled it, for the word 'qaḍā' may be used to mean to fulfill or execute. Hence, the saying of the poet: \"Every debtor settled and repaid his creditor, except 'Azzah, whose creditor is postponed. \"\" \"210 And His, the Almighty's, saying: \"As if it were a *Jann* \" (Al-Qasas: 31). Meaning that the staff became like the *Jann*, which is a white, quick-moving serpent with kohl-rimmed eyes (*akhal al-'ayn*). And His, the Almighty's, saying: \"And draw in your hand to your side, dispelling the fear \" (Al-Qasas: 32). Meaning: place your hand upon your chest so that the terror, panic, and fear which struck you may vanish. And may the blessings of Allah be upon you. To the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Forty-Ninth: Continuation of the Story of Moses (Peace be upon him) 211 Continuation of the Story of Moses Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, guided Moses to present to Pharaoh the sign of the staff and the sign of the hand. When Moses arrived in Egypt and was joined by his brother, Aaron son of Imran, they proceeded to Pharaoh and asked him to dedicate worship solely to Allah. They informed him that they were Messengers of the Lord of the Worlds, and Moses said to him: \"Is there [any inclination] for you to purify yourself, and that I guide you to your Lord so you would fear [Him]? \" (An-Naziat: 18-19). And be happy in this world and the Hereafter? \"I do not say about Allah except the truth \" (Al-A'raf: 105). \"And we have come to you with a sign from your Lord \" (Ta-Ha: 47)—a manifest and overwhelming miracle. So believe in Allah and \"send with us the Children of Israel. \" Pharaoh said: \"Did we not rear you among us as a child, and did you not remain among us for many years of your life? \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 18). \"And you did the deed which you did \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 19), and you are ungrateful for the favor we bestowed upon you. Moses said: I did it unintentionally. I did not intend to kill the Coptic man when I struck him. And knowing that you would not judge this case justly, I fled from you because I was afraid of you. \"Then my Lord granted me authority and made me one of the Messengers \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 21). And it has been revealed to us, O Pharaoh, that the punishment is upon whoever denies the signs of Allah, turns away from the religion of Allah, and rejects the Messengers. Do not be arrogant toward Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Pharaoh said: \"And what is the Lord of the Worlds? \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 23). Moses said: \"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 24). If there is anything one can be certain of, it is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, due to the clarity of His evidence and the certainty of His argument. He is the One who created everything and gave every created thing its distinct characteristic, and then guided it, by the innate nature He placed in it, to its food, drink, the survival of its progeny, and other matters. Thus, land animals, birds, and fish know their paths. Allah, Exalted is He, has deposited in them signs and favors that no one can comprehend except Allah, Exalted is He. In the world are clear signs and decisive proofs that testify they are the creation of the Lord of the Worlds. He has established in every thing in the universe a sign, as the poet said: Stories of the Prophets (The True Story) 212 O wonder! How is the Deity disobeyed, or how does the denier deny Him? And in everything, there is a sign for Him, indicating that He is the One. And even if we spent all the inkwells on Earth to explain the signs of Allah in man, the heavens, the earth, and what is between them, and all that human comprehension has reached, we would be unable to fulfill that. Therefore, Moses sufficed with his saying to Pharaoh: \"He said: Our Lord is the One who gave all things their creation, then guided [them] \" (Ta-Ha: 50). Do you not listen to what he says? Pharaoh said to those around him, having been amazed that Moses claimed the existence of a god other than himself: Moses said: The One who sent me, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, is \"Your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 26). Pharaoh said to his noblemen with him, mockingly and interrupting: \"Indeed, your messenger who has been sent to you is mad \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 27). Moses answered him that the God who sent him is \"The Lord of the East and the West and whatever is between them, if you should reason \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 28). So hasten to belief before His punishment descends upon you. Pharaoh’s interruption of the argument intensified, and he resorted to the threat of imprisonment for Moses, saying: \"If you take a god other than me, I will surely make you among the imprisoned \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 29). Moses did not increase, in the face of this threat, which was met with clear evidence and an overwhelming argument, except advice, saying: Would you imprison me even if I brought you a sign that I am a Messenger from Allah, the Lord of the Worlds? Pharaoh’s foolishness and arrogance increased, and he said to his minister, Haman: \"O Haman, ignite a fire for me upon the clay and make for me a lofty structure \" (Al-Qasas: 38), so that I may ascend and look at the god of Moses and speak to him, if he is truthful that there is a god in the sky. He intended by this to deceive his people and to hold them in low esteem so that the lights of truth brought by Moses would not seep into their hearts. Moses said to him: Will you continue, O Pharaoh, in your denial, even if I brought you \"a manifest thing from the truthful ones \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 30)? Pharaoh said: \"Then bring it, if you should be among the truthful \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 31). So Moses threw his staff, and behold, it was a serpent running on its belly and shaking quickly, as if it were a *Jann*. It began to swell and grow large, so much so that Pharaoh’s heart almost broke. Then Moses put his hand into his bosom and withdrew it, and behold, it was white without any disease (leprosy) or defect, shining brightly. Pharaoh and his people said: \"They said: Indeed, these are two magicians who want to get you out of your land with their magic and do away with your exemplary way of life \" (Ta-Ha: 63). And this magic indicates that it is the magic of a knowledgeable sorcerer. 213 Chapter Forty-Ninth: Continuation of the Story of Moses (Peace be upon him) Pharaoh's council requested that Pharaoh send messengers throughout the cities to gather sorcerers from all parts of Egypt, so that they might come and assemble before Pharaoh to challenge Moses. Pharaoh and his council said to Moses: \"Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses? Then we will surely bring you magic like it. So make an appointment between us and you that neither we nor you will fail \" (Ta-Ha: 57-58), in a mutually agreed-upon place. Moses said: \"Your appointment is the Day of the Festival \" (Ta-Ha: 59), which is their holiday on which they adorn themselves and gather, and that the meeting between us should be at the time of *Duha* (mid-morning). The Noble Qur'an speaks in various places about the coming of Moses and his brother Aaron (peace be upon them) to Pharaoh, their delivery of Allah's message to him, and what transpired between Pharaoh and his council with Moses (peace be upon him). Allah, Exalted is He, says in Surat Al-A'raf, and He is the most truthful of speakers, and what He relates is the best of stories: \"Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his council, but they wronged by them. So see how was the end of the corrupters. And Moses said, 'O Pharaoh, indeed I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds. It is incumbent upon me that I say nothing about Allah except the truth. I have certainly come to you with a clear proof from your Lord, so send with me the Children of Israel.' [Pharaoh] said, 'If you have come with a sign, then bring it forth, if you should be among the truthful.' So [Moses] threw his staff, and suddenly it was a serpent manifest. And he drew out his hand, and suddenly it was white for the observers. Said the eminent ones among the people of Pharaoh, 'Indeed, this is a knowing magician. He wants to get you out of your land—so what do you command?' They said, 'Postpone [the case of] him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers who will bring you every knowing magician' \" (Al-A'raf: 103-112). And He says, Exalted is He, in Surat Yunus: \"Then We sent after them Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his council with Our signs, but they were arrogant and were a criminal people. So when the truth came to them from Us, they said, 'Indeed, this is obvious magic.' Moses said, 'Do you say [thus] about the truth when it has come to you? Is this magic? But magicians will not succeed.' They said, 'Have you come to us to turn us away from that upon which we found our fathers and so that you two may have greatness in the land? And we are not going to believe you.' And Pharaoh said, 'Bring to me every knowing magician' \" (Yunus: 75-79). And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Hud: \"And We certainly sent Moses with Our signs and a clear authority to Pharaoh and his council, but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was not rightly guided \" (Hud: 96-97). Stories of the Prophets (The True Story) 314 And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Ta-Ha concerning Moses and Aaron when they came to Pharaoh: \"Indeed, we are messengers of your Lord, so send with us the Children of Israel and do not torment them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord. And peace will be upon whoever follows the guidance. Indeed, it has been revealed to us that the punishment will be upon whoever denies and turns away. He said, 'So who is your Lord, O Moses?' He said, 'Our Lord is the One who gave everything its creation, then guided [it].' He said, 'Then what about the former generations?' He said, 'Knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a record. My Lord neither errs nor forgets. [It is] He who has made for you the earth a bed and inserted for you into it roads and sent down from the sky rain and produced thereby categories of various plants. Eat and pasture your livestock. Indeed in that are signs for those of understanding' \" (Ta-Ha: 47-54). To the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. 215 Chapter Fiftieth: Continuation of the Story of Moses (Peace be upon him) Chapter Fiftieth: Continuation of the Story of Moses In this chapter, we continue to state what Allah, Exalted is He, mentioned in Surat Ta-Ha concerning the exchanges between Moses and Pharaoh when Moses called Pharaoh to Allah. Allah, Exalted is He, says, while describing what Moses used as proof that Allah alone is the Lord, Master, and Sovereign of all things, and that there is no deity or lord besides Him: \"From it [the earth] We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will extract you another time. And We certainly showed him Our signs, all of them, but he denied and refused. He said, 'Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses? Then we will surely bring you magic like it. So make an appointment between us and you that neither we nor you will fail, in a suitable place.' [Moses] said, 'Your appointment is the Day of the Festival, and let the people be assembled in the morning' \" (Ta-Ha: 55-59). And He says, Exalted is He, in Surat Ash-Shu'ara: \"He said, 'Did we not rear you among us as a child, and did you not remain among us for many years of your life? And you did the deed which you did, and you are ungrateful.' [Moses] said, 'I did it then while I was of those astray [in judgment]. So I fled from you when I feared you. Then my Lord granted me authority and made me one of the Messengers. And is this a favor of which you remind me—that you have enslaved the Children of Israel?' Pharaoh said, 'And what is the Lord of the Worlds?' [Moses] said, 'The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, if you should be convinced.' [Pharaoh] said to those around him, 'Do you not hear?' [Moses] said, 'Your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers.' [Pharaoh] said, 'Indeed, your messenger who has been sent to you is mad.' [Moses] said, 'The Lord of the East and the West and whatever is between them, if you should reason.' [Pharaoh] said, 'If you take a god other than me, I will surely make you among the imprisoned.' [Moses] said, 'Even if I brought you something manifest?' [Pharaoh] said, 'Then bring it, if you should be among the truthful.' So [Moses] threw his staff, and suddenly it was a serpent manifest. And he drew out his hand, and suddenly it was white for the observers. [Pharaoh] said to the eminent ones around him, 'Indeed, this is a knowing magician. He wants to get you out of your land with his magic. So what do you command?' They said, 'Postpone [the case of] him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers who will bring you every knowing magician' \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 18-37). And the Almighty says in Surat An-Naml: \"But when Our signs came to them as clear evidence, they said, 'This is obvious magic.' And they denied them, while their souls were certain of them, out of injustice and arrogance. So see how was the end of the corrupters \" (An-Naml: 13-14). Stories of the Prophets (The True Story) 216 And He, the Almighty, says in Surat Al-Qasas: \"But when Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said, 'This is nothing but invented magic, and we have not heard of this among our forefathers of old.' And Moses said, 'My Lord is more knowing of who has brought guidance from Him and to whom will be the consequence of [this] abode. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.' And Pharaoh said, 'O eminent ones, I do not know of any god for you other than me. O Haman, ignite for me a fire upon the clay and make for me a lofty structure that I may look at the God of Moses. And indeed, I think he is among the liars.' And he was arrogant, he and his soldiers, in the land without right, and they thought that they would not be returned to Us \" (Al-Qasas: 36-39). Manifest. \"And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Ghafir (The Forgiver): \"And We certainly sent Moses with Our signs and a clear authority from Us to Pharaoh, Haman and Korah. But they said, '[He is] a magician and a habitual liar.' So when he brought them the truth from Us, they said, 'Kill the sons of those who have believed with him and keep [only] their women alive.' But the plot of the disbelievers is not except in error. And Pharaoh said, 'Let me kill Moses and let him call upon his Lord. Indeed, I fear that he will change your religion or that he will cause corruption in the land.' And Moses said, 'Indeed, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant person who does not believe in the Day of Account' \" (Ghafir: 23-27). And when Moses manifested this great refuge in Allah alone, a believing man from the family of Pharaoh, who was concealing his faith, began to defend Moses, and in his religion, he started advising Pharaoh and his council of the necessity of hastening to obey Moses and entering his religion, before Allah unleashed upon the deniers the punishment He inflicts on those who deny. Allah says: \"And a believing man from the family of Pharaoh who concealed his faith said, 'Will you kill a man because he says, 'My Lord is Allah,' while he has brought you clear proofs from your Lord? And if he should be a liar, upon him is his lie; but if he should be truthful, there will afflict you some of that which he promises you. Indeed, Allah does not guide one who is a transgressor and a habitual liar. O my people, sovereignty is yours today, [for] you are dominant in the land. But who would protect us from the punishment of Allah if it came to us?' Pharaoh said, 'I only show you what I see, and I do not guide you except to the way of right conduct.' And the one who had believed said, 'O my people, indeed I fear for you [a fate] like the day of the [former] confederates. Like the custom of the people of Noah and 'Aad and Thamud and those after them. And Allah wants no injustice for [His] servants. And O my people, indeed I fear for you the Day of Calling Out (Yawm An-Tanâd). The Day you will turn your backs and flee, [but] you will not have from Allah any protector. And he whom Allah leaves astray—there is for him no guide. And Joseph had certainly come to you before with clear proofs, but you remained in doubt concerning that which he brought you. Until when he died, you said, 'Never will Allah send a messenger after him.' \" (Ghafir: 28-34). 217 Chapter Fiftieth: Continuation of the Story of Moses (Peace be upon him) \"Thus does Allah leave astray him who is a transgressor and a doubter. Those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah without any authority having come to them—greatly hateful is that in the sight of Allah and in the sight of those who have believed. Thus does Allah seal over every heart of an arrogant tyrant. And Pharaoh said, 'O Haman, build for me a lofty structure that perhaps I may reach the ways—the ways of the heavens—that I may look at the God of Moses; but indeed, I think he is a liar.' And thus was made pleasing to Pharaoh the evil of his deed, and he was averted from the [right] way. And the plot of Pharaoh was not except in ruin. \" (Ghafir: 34-37). And when Pharaoh reached this degree of tyranny and transgression, the man spoke out and announced his faith: \"And the one who had believed said, 'O my people, follow me; I will guide you to the way of right conduct. O my people, this worldly life is only [temporary] enjoyment, and indeed the Hereafter—that is the home of [permanent] settlement. Whoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except by the like thereof; but whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer—those will enter Paradise, being provided for therein without account. And O my people, why do I call you to salvation while you call me to the Fire? You call me to disbelieve in Allah and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, and I call you to the Exalted in Might, the Perpetual Forgiver. Assuredly, what you call me to has no claim [to being a god] in this world or in the Hereafter, and indeed, our return is to Allah, and indeed, the transgressors will be the companions of the Fire. And you will remember what I [now] say to you, and I entrust my affair to Allah. Indeed, Allah is Seeing of [His] servants.' So Allah protected him from the evils of what they plotted, and the worst of punishment enveloped the people of Pharaoh \" (Ghafir: 38-45). And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Az-Zukhruf (The Gold Adornments): \"But when he brought them Our signs, suddenly they were laughing at them \" (Az-Zukhruf: 47). And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Ad-Dukhan (The Smoke): \"[Saying], 'Send out [in safety] the servants of Allah. Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger. And [warn them], 'Do not be arrogant toward Allah. Indeed, I have come to you with clear authority. And indeed, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest you stone me. But if you do not believe me, then leave me alone' \" (Ad-Dukhan: 18-21). And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Adh-Dhariyat (The Winnowing Winds): \"And in Moses, when We sent him to Pharaoh with manifest authority. But he turned away with his power and said, '[He is] a magician or a madman' \" (Adh-Dhariyat: 38-39). And He, the Almighty, said in Surat An-Naziat (Those Who Pull Out): \"And he showed him the greatest sign. But [Pharaoh] denied and disobeyed. Then he turned his back, striving [against the truth]. And he gathered [his people] and called out. And said, 'I am your Lord, the Most High' \" (An-Naziat: 20-24). And to the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. 218 Chapter Fifty-First: Continuation of the Story of Moses (The True Stories of the Prophets) Pharaoh gathered the expert sorcerers from all the cities of Egypt. Sorcery at that time was the most important goal of education in their land. They had reached a level in it that no one before them had reached, and it is not known that anyone after them ever reached it. The divine custom has been that Allah sends every prophet with a miracle that surpasses the highest degrees of the knowledge in which his people excelled, so that the truth may be more manifest, and they may know that it is from Allah and that no human can produce its like. That is why He sent Muhammad with the Qur'an and made it his greatest miracle, because the people of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) excelled in eloquence, expression, and rhetoric to the extent that they erected pulpits for orators and poets in the markets of Ukadh, Majannah, and Dhul-Majaz. Similarly, He sent Jesus (peace be upon him) with the healing of the blind and the leper and the resurrection of the dead by Allah's permission, because his people had reached a remarkable level in medicine that had not been preceded. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, described what happened between Moses, the sorcerers, Pharaoh, and his council, and how the sorcerers hastened to believe in Moses when they cast down their ropes and staffs. It appeared to Moses that they were moving, and he felt a secret fear within himself. So Allah reassured him and ordered him to throw his staff, and it turned into a massive serpent and swallowed everything they had fabricated. The sorcerers became certain that this could only be done by the One who created power and destiny. So they fell down to Allah, prostrating, declaring their faith in Allah and His messengers, patiently enduring every affliction that struck them for the sake of Allah's pleasure. Concerning this, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says in Surat Al-A'raf (The Heights): \"And when the sorcerers came to Pharaoh, they said, 'Indeed for us is there a reward if we are the victors?' He said, 'Yes, and indeed, you will then be among those brought near [to me].' They said, 'O Moses, either you throw, or we will be the ones to throw.' He said, 'Throw.' And when they threw, they enchanted the eyes of the people and terrified them and brought forth a great magic. And We inspired to Moses, 'Throw your staff,' and immediately it devoured what they were in the act of fabricating. So the truth was established, and abolished was all that they were doing. Thus were they defeated right there and became [a] humiliated [group]. And the sorcerers fell down prostrating. They said, 'We believe in the Lord of the worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron.' [Pharaoh] said, 'You believed in him before I gave you permission. Indeed, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city to expel therefrom its people. But you are going to know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides; then I will surely crucify you all.' They said, 'Indeed, to our Lord we will return. And you do not resent us except because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord, pour upon us patience and let us die as Muslims [in submission to You]' \" (Al-A'raf: 113-126). And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Yunus (Jonah): \"And when the sorcerers came, Moses said to them, 'Throw whatever you will throw.' And when they threw, Moses said, 'What you have brought is magic. Indeed, Allah will expose its worthlessness. Indeed, Allah does not amend the work of corrupters. And Allah confirms the truth by His words, even though the criminals detest it' \" (Yunus: 80-82). And He, the Almighty, says in Surat Ta-Ha: \"So Pharaoh turned away and gathered his plot; then he came. Moses said to them, 'Woe to you! Do not invent a lie against Allah or He will exterminate you with a punishment; and he who invents [a lie] has failed.' So they disputed over their affair among themselves and spoke secretly in whispers. They said, 'Indeed, these are two magicians who want to get you out of your land with their magic and do away with your exemplary way of life. So gather your plan and then come [forward] in ranks. And he has succeeded today who overcomes.' They said, 'O Moses, either you throw, or we will be the first to throw.' He said, 'Rather, you throw.' And suddenly their ropes and their staffs seemed to him from their magic to be moving. And Moses sensed within himself apprehension. We said, 'Fear not. Indeed, it is you who will be superior. And throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have made. What they have made is but the deception of a magician, and the magician will not succeed wherever he goes.' So the sorcerers fell down in prostration. They said, 'We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.' [Pharaoh] said, 'You believed in him before I gave you permission. Indeed, he is your chief who taught you magic. So I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you upon the trunks of palm trees, and you will surely know which of us is more severe in [giving] punishment and more lasting.' They said, 'We will not prefer you over what has come to us of clear proofs and [over] the One who created us. So decree what you are going to decree. You can only decree concerning this worldly life. Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and the magic to which you compelled us. And Allah is better and more lasting' \" (Ta-Ha: 60-73). And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Ash-Shu'ara (The Poets): \"So the sorcerers were gathered together for the appointment of a known day. And it was said to the people, 'Are you [also] gathering? That we might follow the sorcerers if they should be the victors.' And when the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh, 'Is there indeed for us a reward if we are the victors?' He said, 'Yes, and indeed, you will then be among those brought near [to me].' Moses said to them, 'Throw what you will throw.' So they threw their ropes and staffs and said, 'By the might of Pharaoh, indeed, we are the victors.' 220 Stories of the Prophets (The True Story) Then Moses threw his staff, and suddenly it devoured that which they were fabricating. So the sorcerers fell down in prostration. They said, 'We believe in the Lord of the worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron.' [Pharaoh] said, 'You believed in him before I gave you permission. Indeed, he is your chief who taught you magic. But you are going to know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you all.' They said, 'No harm. Indeed, to our Lord we will return. Indeed, we aspire that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we were the first of the believers' \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 38-51). And His, the Almighty's, saying in Surat Al-A'raf: \"They said, 'O Moses, either you throw, or we will be the ones to throw.' \" (Al-A'raf: 115), and His, the Almighty's, saying in Surat Ta-Ha: \"They said, 'O Moses, either you throw, or we will be the first to throw.' \" (Ta-Ha: 65), indicates that when Allah wills to manifest His proof, He prepares the means for that manifestation, and He guided Moses to ask them to be the ones to begin the throwing. So when they came with that great magic that terrified the people, even Moses, and then Moses threw his single staff, it turned into a massive serpent that devoured and swallowed all their ropes and staffs which had turned into running serpents, so that this might be the most complete way to manifest this miracle that annihilated their fabrication, their magic, and their falsehood. And His, the Almighty's, saying: \"Thus were they defeated right there and became [a] humiliated [group] \" (Al-A'raf: 119), indicates the dishonor, abasement, and humiliation that afflicted Pharaoh and his people upon the appearance of this miracle. And His, the Almighty's, saying: \"So the sorcerers fell down in prostration \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 46), indicates that the lights of truth rushed into the hearts of these sorcerers, and they did not hesitate to surrender to Allah, submit to His religion, and believe in His messengers. The joy of the truth mingled with the inner core of their hearts because they were the most knowledgeable of the people that what Moses had brought was not sorcery. And His, the Almighty's, saying: \"Pharaoh said, 'You believed in him before I gave you permission' \" (Al-A'raf: 123), indicates that Pharaoh was certain that what Moses had brought was the truth from Allah. However, his wretchedness made him try to maintain some of his authority, even over the faith of those whose hearts Allah expanded to Islam. And His, the Almighty's, saying: \"Indeed, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city to expel therefrom its people \" (Al-A'raf: 123), and His saying: \"Indeed, he is your chief who taught you magic \" (Ta-Ha: 71), 221 Chapter Fifty-First: Continuation of the Story of Moses indicates Pharaoh's confusion in assigning accusations to these believers to mislead his people and attempt to turn them away from this clear truth. But the plot of Pharaoh was only in error. And to the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. 222 Chapter Fifty-Second: Continuation of the Story of Moses (The True Stories of the Prophets) I pointed out at the end of the previous chapter that when Pharaoh saw Moses’ staff turn into a serpent and swallow the great magic presented by the sorcerers, and the sorcerers believed in the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron, and were not affected by Pharaoh’s threats to cut off their hands and feet on opposite sides and crucify them on palm trunks, and because of their steadfastness on the truth and their asking Allah to pour upon them patience to endure all forms of torment from Pharaoh for the sake of their faith in Allah, Pharaoh became certain that what Moses had brought was the truth beyond doubt, and he and his council were convinced that Moses was a Messenger of Allah. This affected Pharaoh with fear of harming Moses, and he confined himself to threatening and intimidating Moses, which is clearly demonstrated in His saying: \"Let me kill Moses and let him call upon his Lord. Indeed, I fear that he will change your religion or that he will cause corruption in the land \" (Ghafir: 26). Was he tied by a rope that prevented him from killing Moses? No, but it was an empty threat indicating that he sensed that Moses was a Messenger of Allah. Nevertheless, he and his people insisted on intensifying the humiliating torment upon the Children of Israel, and they increased the killing of their sons and the keeping alive of their women. And Allah protected Moses from being reached by Pharaoh’s hand, just as He protected Muhammad from Abu Jahl and those with him from reaching the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad. Allah revealed to Moses and Aaron to settle their people in houses in Egypt, to make their houses a direction of prayer (*Qibla*), to establish the prayer, and for Moses to continue giving glad tidings to the believers of Allah's victory and support. When Pharaoh began to announce the intensification of the humiliating torment upon the Children of Israel and that they must be subdued, \"Moses said to his people, 'Seek help through Allah and be patient. Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah. He causes to inherit it whom He wills of His servants. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous' \" (Al-A'raf: 128). The people of Moses said to him: We were persecuted before you came to us with the message and after you came with it. He said to them: 223 Chapter Fifty-Second: Continuation of the Story of Moses \"Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and grant you succession in the land, that He may see how you will do \" (Al-A'raf: 129). And the signs of Allah’s victory for Moses and the believers with him began. Allah inflicted upon the people of Pharaoh drought, famine, and decreased harvests, perhaps they would awaken from their error and deviation. But instead, they started claiming that what had afflicted them was due to the magic of Moses, and they took bad omens from him and those with him. Moses answered them that the cause of their calamity was their disbelief and denial of Moses, who were the Messengers of Allah. They again claimed that this drought and famine were the result of Moses’ magic. Since they would never believe in Him, Allah sent upon them the Flood (At-Tufan), which drowned their farms. When the Flood ended and the earth began to yield its fruits, Allah sent upon them the Locusts (Al-Jarad), which destroyed their crops and fruits. Then He sent upon them the Lice (Al-Qummal), which are small gnats, or the *Dabba* (larvae or a small insect with a red wing), or something resembling a bad-smelling tick. These Lice mixed with them in all their situations; they did not touch anything without finding them. Then Allah sent upon them the Frogs (Ad-Dafadi'), which filled their houses, food, and drink. Then Allah sent upon them the Blood (Ad-Dam), and their waters were covered with it. They would not consume anything without finding it, and the blood mingled with their food and drink. Despite all these punishments, one of the signs of Allah was that He protected the Children of Israel from all these calamities. When this affliction intensified upon Pharaoh and his council, \"They said, 'O Moses, invoke for us your Lord by what He has entrusted to you. If you remove the affliction from us, we will surely believe in you and will send with you the Children of Israel' \" (Al-A'raf: 134). But these were detailed signs; whenever Allah removed the affliction from them, they immediately broke their covenant. Despite their certainty that it was from Allah, Exalted is He, they denied them and laughed at them. Pharaoh said to Moses: \"Indeed, I think you are bewitched, O Moses \" (Al-Isra: 101). Moses said to him: You have known that these nine signs—the staff, the hand, and what came after them (the drought, decreased harvests, the Flood, the Locusts, the Lice, the Frogs, and the Blood)—all are from Allah, that perhaps you may be guided. \"And indeed, I think you are one destroyed, O Pharaoh \" (Al-Isra: 102), because of your disbelief and deviation. 224 Stories of the Prophets (The True Story) Moses prayed against Pharaoh and his people, saying: \"Our Lord, indeed You have given Pharaoh and his establishment splendor and properties in the worldly life, Our Lord, that they may lead [people] astray from Your way \" (Yunus: 88). Instead of thanking You for them, they used them to turn [people] away from Your way. \"Our Lord, destroy their properties \" (i.e., annihilate them) \"and harden their hearts \" (i.e., seal them), \"so that they will not believe until they see the painful punishment \" (Yunus: 88). Moses reached this point just when Pharaoh decided that it was imperative to declare war on Moses. Pharaoh sent summoners throughout the cities to gather equipment, weapons, and men to eliminate Moses, Aaron, and the believing Children of Israel with them, offering them all kinds of allurements. Allah revealed to Moses to leave Egypt at night with the Children of Israel, hurrying towards Sinai. He informed him that Pharaoh and his soldiers would follow them. Moses hastened to comply with his Lord's command, and he traveled at night with the Children of Israel. When Pharaoh's army was gathered, they rushed to pursue Moses, led by Pharaoh, upon whom is the curse of Allah. They followed them at sunrise (*mushriqin*). Moses and those with him reached a difficult place: the sea in front of them, the enemy behind them, and mountains to their right and left. When the two companies—Moses' company and Pharaoh's company—saw each other, the companions of Moses said: \"Indeed, we are overtaken \" (Inna lamudrakun), meaning our destruction will be here at the hands of Pharaoh and his soldiers, because there is no escape for us. Moses answered them and said: No, they will not overtake us, and they will not reach us, because Allah has promised me that. Moses meant Allah's promise to him when Moses said: \"Our Lord, indeed we fear that he may hasten against us or that he may transgress \" (Ta-Ha: 45). He said: \"Fear not. Indeed, I am with you both; I hear and I see \" (Ta-Ha: 46). Therefore, when his companions said to him: \"Indeed, we are overtaken \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 61), he answered them with His saying: \"No! Indeed, with me is my Lord; He will guide me \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 62). Then Allah revealed to Moses to strike the sea with his staff. Moses struck the sea with his staff, and it split. Each side of the water was like a massive towering mountain (*At-Tawd Al-'Azîm*). By this, Allah made for them a dry path in the sea. They did not fear being overtaken or submerged. Moses and those with him walked on solid, dry ground, with a wall of water on each side of their path, like carved rock. When Moses and those with him came out of 225 Chapter Fifty-Second: Continuation of the Story of Moses the sea, Allah ordered him to leave the sea calm so that Pharaoh and his soldiers would enter it. When Pharaoh and his soldiers were in the sea (Al-Yamm), what covered them from the sea covered them, and Pharaoh misled his people and did not guide them. When drowning overtook him, he said: \"I believe that there is no deity except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims. \" But this faith did not benefit him, and it did not save him from the punishment of Allah. The sea cast out his corpse for those of his people who remained to see, so that they might know the power of Allah over him. This occurred on the Day of Ashura. And to the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. 226 Chapter Fifty-Third: Continuation of the Story of Moses (The True Stories of the Prophets) I mentioned at the end of the previous chapter that the drowning of Pharaoh and the salvation of Moses took place on the Day of Ashura. Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported in their *Sahih*s, on the authority of a hadith from Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both), that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Medina, he found the Jews fasting on the Day of Ashura. They said: This is a great day. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked them: What is this day you fast? They replied: This is a day when Allah saved Moses and his people and drowned Pharaoh and his people. Moses fasted it in gratitude, so we fast it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: We are more entitled and closer to Moses than you. So he fasted it and commanded the fasting of it. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, mentioned the stance of Pharaoh's council towards Moses and his people after the sorcerers believed in several places in His Noble Book, where He says in Surat Al-A'raf: \"And the eminent ones among the people of Pharaoh said, 'Will you leave Moses and his people to cause corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods?' [Pharaoh] said, 'We will kill their sons and keep their women alive; and indeed, we are powerful over them.' Moses said to his people, 'Seek help through Allah and be patient. Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah. He causes to inherit it whom He wills of His servants. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous.' They said, 'We have been persecuted before you came to us and after you came to us.' He said, 'Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and grant you succession in the land, that He may see how you will do. And We certainly afflicted the people of Pharaoh with years of famine and deficiency in crops that perhaps they would be reminded. But when good fortune came to them, they said, 'This is [due] to us.' And if a bad omen struck them, they ascribed it to the evil omens of Moses and those with him. Unquestionably, their evil omens are only from Allah, but most of them do not know. And they said, 'Whatever sign you bring us with which to bewitch us—we will not be believers in you.' So We sent upon them the flood and locusts and lice and frogs and blood as distinct signs, but they were arrogant and were a criminal people. And when the punishment descended upon them, they said, 'O Moses, invoke for us your Lord by what He has entrusted to you. If you remove the affliction from us, we will surely believe in you 227 Chapter Fifty-Third: Continuation of the Story of Moses and will send with you the Children of Israel.' But when We removed the affliction from them until a [specified] term which they were to reach, immediately they broke their word. So We took retribution from them, and drowned them in the sea because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them. And We caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern regions of the land and the western ones, which We had blessed. And the good word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of what they had patiently endured. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people were producing and what they were building \" (Al-A'raf: 127-137). And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Yunus: \"But none had believed with Moses except a few descendants of his people, for fear of Pharaoh and his establishment that they would persecute them. And indeed, Pharaoh was an arrogant tyrant in the land, and indeed, he was of the transgressors. And Moses said, 'O my people, if you have believed in Allah, then rely upon Him, if you should be Muslims [in submission].' So they said, 'Upon Allah do we rely. Our Lord, make us not [objects of] trial for the wrongdoing people. And save us by Your mercy from the disbelieving people.' And We inspired to Moses and his brother, 'Settle your people in houses in Egypt and make your houses a direction of prayer and establish prayer. And give good tidings to the believers.' And Moses said, 'Our Lord, indeed You have given Pharaoh and his establishment splendor and properties in the worldly life, Our Lord, that they may lead [people] astray from Your way. Our Lord, destroy their properties and harden their hearts so that they will not believe until they see the painful punishment.' [Allah] said, 'Your prayer has been answered. So remain on a right course and do not follow the way of those who do not know.' And We took the Children of Israel across the sea; and Pharaoh and his soldiers followed them in transgression and hostility until, when the drowning overtook him, he said, 'I believe that there is no deity except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims.' Now? And you had already disobeyed before and were of the corrupters. So today We will save you with your body that you may be to those who succeed you a sign. And indeed, many among the people are heedless of Our signs \" (Yunus: 83-92). And He said in Surat Hud: \"And We certainly sent Moses with Our signs and a clear authority to Pharaoh and his council, but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was not rightly guided. He will precede his people on the Day of Resurrection and lead them into the Fire; and wretched is the landing place to which they are led. And they were followed in this [world] with a curse and on the Day of Resurrection. And wretched is the gift which is given \" (Hud: 96-99). And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Ta-Ha: \"And We had inspired to Moses, 'Travel by night with My servants and strike for them a dry path in the sea; you will not fear being overtaken [by Pharaoh] nor be afraid [of drowning].' So Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, and there covered them from the sea that which covered them. And Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide [them] \" (Ta-Ha: 77-79). And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Ash-Shu'ara: \"And We inspired to Moses, 'Travel by night with My servants; indeed, you will be pursued.' Then Pharaoh sent [messengers] into the cities to gather [his army], [saying], 'Indeed, these are a small band, and indeed, they have enraged us, and indeed, we are a cautious assembly.' So We removed them from gardens and springs 228 Stories of the Prophets (The True Story) and treasures and honorable position. Thus. And We caused to inherit it the Children of Israel. So they pursued them at sunrise. And when the two companies saw one another, the companions of Moses said, 'Indeed, we are overtaken!' [Moses] said, 'No! Indeed, with me is my Lord; He will guide me.' Then We inspired to Moses, 'Strike with your staff the sea,' and it split, and each side was like a great towering mountain. And We advanced thereto the pursuers. And We saved Moses and those with him, all together. Then We drowned the others. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not believers. And indeed, your Lord, He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful \" (Ash-Shu'ara: 52-68). And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Al-Qasas (The Stories): \"And Pharaoh said, 'O eminent ones, I have not known for you any god other than me. O Haman, ignite for me a fire upon the clay and make for me a lofty structure that I may look at the God of Moses. And indeed, I think he is a liar.' And he was arrogant, he and his soldiers, in the land without right, and they thought that they would not be returned to Us. So We seized him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea. Look therefore how was the end of the wrongdoers. And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped. And We caused to follow them in this world a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the despised \" (Al-Qasas: 38-42). And as He, the Almighty, said in Surat Al-Isra (The Night Journey): \"And We certainly gave Moses nine clear signs. So ask the Children of Israel [about] when he came to them and Pharaoh said to him, 'Indeed, I think you are bewitched, O Moses.' [Moses] said, 'You have certainly known that none has sent down these [signs] except the Lord of the heavens and the earth as evidence, and indeed, I think you are destined to destruction, O Pharaoh.' So he intended to dislodge them from the land, but We drowned him and those with him all together \" (Al-Isra: 101-103). And He, the Almighty, said in Surat Az-Zukhruf: \"And We certainly sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his council, and he said, 'Indeed, I am the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds.' But when he brought them Our signs, suddenly they were laughing at them. And We showed them no sign except that it was greater than its predecessor. And We seized them with the punishment that perhaps they might return [to faith]. And they said, 'O magician, invoke for us your Lord by what He has entrusted to you. Indeed, we will be rightly guided.' But when We removed the punishment from them, at once they broke their word. And Pharaoh called out among his people; he said, 'O my people, does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these rivers flowing beneath me? Then do you not see? Or am I better than this one who is contemptible and can barely make himself clear? Then why were not bracelets of gold lowered onto him or did the angels not come with him in [immediate] accompaniment?' So he made fools of his people, 229 Chapter Fifty-Third: Continuation of the Story of Moses and they obeyed him. Indeed, they were a defiantly disobedient people. And when they angered Us, We took retribution from them and drowned them all. And We made them a precedent and an example for the later peoples \" (Az-Zukhruf: 46-56). And as He, the Almighty, said in Surat Al-Qamar (The Moon): \"And there certainly came to the people of Pharaoh the warners. They denied Our signs, all of them, so We seized them with the seizure of one Exalted in Might and Perfectly Able \" (Al-Qamar: 41-42), in addition to other verses. And to the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. 230 Chapter Fifty-Fourth: Continuation of the Story of Moses (The True Stories of the Prophets) After Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, saved Moses and Aaron and their people from the great affliction, and drowned Pharaoh and the deniers with him, and Allah caused the Children of Israel to cross the sea, Moses' difficulties with Pharaoh and his people ended, and Moses and Aaron's difficulties with the Children of Israel began. For, after they had seen the greatest sign of Allah in the splitting of the sea for them and the drowning of Pharaoh and his soldiers, and after the good word of Allah had been fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of their patience, as soon as they crossed the sea, they came upon a people devoted to idols which they were worshiping. Some of them said to Moses: \"O Moses, make for us a god just as they have gods \" (Al-A'raf: 138). Moses responded to them that this request was from your ignorance. How could you forget the favor of Allah in saving you from your enemy and drowning him, while you are new to this experience? If you had known, you would have increased your faith in Allah alone and disbelieved in all besides Him, such as idols, fetishes, and rivals. \"Indeed, these [people] are to be destroyed as to what they are practicing, and futile is whatever they are doing \" (Al-A'raf: 139). Meaning: destined for destruction, corrupt, and brings nothing but evil to its adherents, and no good is derived from it. All worship to other than Allah is false, and worship is only rightful for Allah alone. Allah is the one most in need of no partners. Whoever associates others with Him, He rejects him and his association, and frustrates his work. \"He said, 'Is it a god other than Allah I should seek for you?' \" (Al-A'raf: 140). Meaning: Should I seek for you something to worship other than Allah? This interrogation is for disapproval, astonishment, and reprimand. Then Moses explained to them that Allah had preferred them over the people of their time, as He had sent His Messenger and Interlocutor to them, and they had believed in him. Thus, it was not appropriate for some of them to request a deity other than Allah to resemble the polytheistic idol worshipers. It was not all of the Children of Israel who requested another god, but rather the request of some of their ignorant ones. Concerning this, Allah, Exalted is He, says: \"And We took the Children of Israel across the sea; and they came upon a people devoted to some idols of theirs. They said, 'O Moses, make for us a god just as they have gods.' He said, 'Indeed, you are a people behaving ignorantly. Indeed, these [people] are to be destroyed as to what they are practicing, and futile is whatever they are doing.' He said, 'Is it a god other than Allah I should seek for you while He has preferred you over the worlds?' \" (Al-A'raf: 138-140). 231 Chapter Fifty-Fourth: Continuation of the Story of Moses Many commentators and scholars of the Prophet's biography mentioned a report through Ma'mar from Az-Zuhri from Sinan ibn Abi Sinan Ad-Dili, from Abu Waqid Al-Laythi, who said: We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) before [the battle of] Hunayn, and we passed by a jujube tree (*Sidra*). I said: O Prophet of Allah, make for us a Dhat Anwat just as the disbelievers have a Dhat Anwat. The disbelievers used to hang their weapons on a jujube tree and devote themselves to it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Allah is the greatest! This is exactly what the Children of Israel said to Moses: 'Make for us a god just as they have gods.' And indeed, you are following the ways of those who came before you. \" Ibn Kathir said in his *Tafsir*: Ibn Jarir reported it, and Ibn Abi Hatim reported it from the hadith of Kathir ibn Abdullah ibn Amr ibn Auf Al-Muzani from his father from his grandfather as *Marfu'* (attributed to the Prophet). End of quote. I said: Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar in *At-Taqrib* said: Kathir ibn Abdullah ibn Amr Al-Muzani Al-Madani is weak, from the seventh category, and some of them attributed lying to him. End of quote. If this report is authentic, it is to be interpreted as the saying of one of those who were new to the era of ignorance (*Jahiliyyah*), as is explicitly stated in a narration from Abu Waqid Al-Laythi. They said: The disbelievers of Quraysh and others among the Arabs had a great green tree called Dhat Anwat. They used to come to it every year, hang their weapons on it, slaughter at it, and devote themselves to it for a day. Abu Bakr At-Turtushi Al-Maliki said: Look—may Allah have mercy on you—wherever you find a jujube tree or any tree that people seek out, venerate, hope for healing from it, and drive nails and hang rags on it, cut it down. It is to be noted that when Allah sent Moses to Pharaoh, He sent him with the fundamentals of religion: the Oneness of God (Tawhid), the establishment of prayer for the remembrance of Allah, and the obligation to believe in the Resurrection after death. The Torah had not yet been revealed to him. When Moses' specific mission with Pharaoh and his council ended, and Allah drowned Pharaoh and his soldiers, Moses proceeded to Sinai and became focused on the Children of Israel, who were in dire need of a system that would encompass their needs for their worldly life and their afterlife. Allah prepared Moses to give him the Torah, which contained the laws that would guide its people to the straight path of Allah. This situation of Moses resembles the situation of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in his prophetic life before 232 Stories of the Prophets (The True Story) the Hijra and after it, The Meccan Quran was revealed to establish Monotheism (Tawhid), the Prophetic Message (Risalah), and Faith, including the affirmation of the state system through the Resurrection after death. As for the Medinan Quran, it is an increase for the individual's well-being in this life and the Hereafter, the Islamic State and the happy society, and all that every mission requires. Therefore, the Glorious Quran conveyed what Allah commanded Moses when He chose him with Monotheism, Prayer, and belief in the Resurrection after death, where He says: *“O Moses! Verily, I am your Lord! So take off your shoes; you are in the sacred valley of Tuwa. And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed. Verily, I am Allah! There is no god but Me, so worship Me and establish the Prayer for My remembrance. Indeed, the Hour is coming — I am almost concealing it — so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives. So let not the one who does not believe in it and follows his desire avert you from it, lest you perish. Go to Pharaoh; indeed, he has transgressed all bounds.”* [Ta-Ha: 11-16]. And He said: *“Go to Pharaoh; verily, he has transgressed. And say to him: 'Would you purify yourself? And that I guide you to your Lord so you would fear Him?'”* [An-Naziat: 17-19]. When Allah drowned Pharaoh and saved the Children of Israel, Moses had a state. He was in need of the comprehensive system and the Light which he would follow for his guidance and the guidance of the believers to the Straight Path. Allah appointed for him forty nights in preparation for receiving the Law (Sharia). Some of his people, the obstinate and demanding ones, asked him to show them Allah openly, and to ask his Lord for that. When the appointed time came, Moses said to his brother Aaron: *“Succeed me among my people and put things in order, and do not follow the way of the mischief-makers.”* [Al-A'raf: 142]. No sooner had Moses departed to receive the Law at Mount Tur than Samiri led the Children of Israel astray. He fashioned for them a calf from their gold jewelry, a mere body which had a lowing sound (an audible sound and a clatter similar to the sound of a bull), and said to them: *“This is your god and the god of Moses!”* [Ta-Ha: 88]. A great number of the Children of Israel worshipped it. Aaron tried to turn them away from worshipping the calf. Gentleness prevailed in his nature, and he feared that if he were severe, they would disperse. The worshippers of the calf showed him hostility and nearly killed him when he warned them against worshipping the calf, and he was not authorized to fight them. So he waited for Moses to return with the Law from Allah. To the next chapter, if Allah wills, and peace and the mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you. ### Chapter Fifty-Five Continued: Moses When Moses came to the appointed time with his Lord, he had chosen seventy men from his people for this meeting. When they reached the mountain, *“And Allah spoke to Moses with direct speech.”* [An-Nisa: 164]. Moses said: *“O my Lord! Show (Yourself) to me, that I may look upon You.”* He said: *“You will not see Me. But look upon the mountain; if it remains in its place, then you will see Me.”* [Al-A'raf: 143]. Moses meant that if this Mount Tur does not collapse when Allah manifests His Glory to it, then you will be able to see Me. Allah intended to give Moses and others an example that He is veiled from His creation by Light because they are not fit in this worldly life for the sight of Allah. They will only see Him if they die upon faith in the Hereafter. Believers will not see their Lord until they die. His Veil is Light or Fire; if He were to remove it, the Splendor of His Face would surely burn whatever His sight reaches of His creation. Some followers of misguided desires have claimed that His saying: *“You will not see Me (lan tarani)”* is evidence of the absolute impossibility of seeing Allah, alleging that *'lan'* implies perpetual negation. They ignored His saying concerning the Jews: *“Wish for death, if you are truthful!”* [Al-Baqarah: 94], then He said: *“But they will never (lan yatamannawhu abada) wish for it, because of what their hands have sent forth.”* [Al-Baqarah: 95], even though they will wish for death in Hell, as when they call out with their like among the disbelievers: *“O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us!”* [Az-Zukhruf: 77]. When Allah manifested His Glory to the mountain, He *“made it level with the ground (dakkan), and Moses fell down unconscious (sa'iqan).”* [Al-A'raf: 143]. When he recovered, he said: *“Exalted are You! I repent to You, and I am the first of the believers.”* When Moses saw that the seventy men with him were still unconscious, he supplicated to Allah to revive them. He apologized to Allah, explaining that he wanted to dispel the doubt of those foolish ones who had asked him to show them their Lord openly. Allah answered Moses' prayer, and the seventy men recovered from their unconsciousness. The Truth said to Moses: *“O Moses, I have chosen you over the people for My messages and My words. So take what I have given you and be among the grateful.”* [Al-A'raf: 144]. And He gave him the Tablets, on which He had written for him *“everything as an instruction and a detail for all things”* [Al-A'raf: 145] that the Children of Israel needed for their worldly life and their Hereafter. Near the Mount, when Moses approached the place of confidential conversation, he hastened to the right, preceding the seventy men who were with him. The All-Knowing and All-Aware asked him: *“What made you hasten away from your people, O Moses?”* He said: *“They are close upon my footsteps, and I hastened to You, my Lord, that You might be pleased.”* [Ta-Ha: 83-84]. Among the fruits of this question and answer is the establishment that hastening to good deeds and competing for Allah's pleasure are religiously loved matters, and that not all haste leads to regret. After Allah gave Moses the Torah, He informed him that his people had worshipped a calf made for them by the Samiri. Moses returned to his people with the Torah, angry and grieved at what his people had done. He began to reproach and scold them for worshipping the calf, saying to them: *“Evil is that which you did after me!”* [Al-A'raf: 150]. *“Did your Lord not promise you a good promise?”* [Ta-Ha: 86] — the sending down of the Torah as a light for you. *“Did the term seem too long to you, or did you wish that wrath from your Lord should descend upon you, so you broke your promise to me of adhering to faith and sincerely worshipping Allah alone?”* It is as if they hastened the punishment of Allah. They tried to excuse themselves by saying that they were unable to repel the Samiri's misguidance, for he tempted them with what he tempted, overpowered their minds, and claimed that it was the god of Moses, and that Moses had forgotten his Lord and went to seek his Lord near the mountain. Aaron had warned his people against worshipping the calf and had said to them: *“O my people! You are only being tested by it, and indeed, your Lord is the Most Merciful, so follow me and obey my command.”* They said: *“We will not cease being devoted to it until Moses returns to us.”* [Ta-Ha: 90-91]. Moses, addressing Aaron, said: *“O Aaron! What prevented you, when you saw them going astray, from following me? Did you disobey my order?”* [Ta-Ha: 92-93] — the order to put an end to the way of the mischief-makers. Moses' anger reached such a peak that he threw the Tablets down and seized his brother Aaron by the head and beard, dragging him towards him. Aaron said: *“O son of my mother! Indeed, the people made me weak and almost killed me. So do not let the enemies rejoice over me and do not place me with the wrongdoing people.”* [Al-A'raf: 150]. And Aaron said to Moses: *“O son of my mother! Do not seize me by my beard or by my head! Indeed, I feared that you would say, 'You caused division among the Children of Israel and did not regard my word.' ”* [Ta-Ha: 94]. He sought to appeal to Moses' compassion by saying: *“O son of my mother,”* although he was his full brother. This is similar to the saying of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to Ali: *“You are to me in the position of Aaron to Moses, except that there will be no prophet after me.”* [The bond between them is Islam. Fatima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah, was his wife, and his children were under his guardianship, and the tenderness of the Messenger of Allah towards her and her children needs no proof.] Some followers of misguided desires have tried to use this Hadith as evidence that Ali is the Caliph of the Messenger of Allah, but this deduction is false for several reasons: Aaron died before Moses and was not his successor. The successor after Moses was Joshua bin Nun. Moreover, this Hadith is not an explicit text about Ali being the Imam after the Messenger of Allah. The context of the Hadith clarifies the Messenger of Allah's intention. When the Messenger of Allah set out for Tabuk and left Ali in Medina, some hypocrites in Medina said that he only left Ali there because he despised him. When Ali heard this, he took his sword and caught up with the Messenger of Allah while he was at Al-Jurf, and informed him of the hypocrites' words. The Messenger of Allah said to him: *“Are you not pleased to be to me in the position of Aaron to Moses, except that there will be no prophet after me?”* It is as if the Prophet was explaining to Ali that his deputizing was not like Moses' deputizing of Aaron when Moses went to the appointed time with his Lord. Moses' deputizing of Aaron had a meaning of affection, as mentioned by Shaykh Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him). Likewise, the tenderness Moses felt for Aaron is similar to that between the Messenger of Allah and Ali. After Moses' anger subsided, he took the Tablets, and its text (or its version) contained *“guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord.”* [Al-A'raf: 154]. In the promise to Moses to give him the Torah, the choice of the seventy men, his absence, Moses' recommendations, his appointment of Aaron as successor over the Children of Israel, the worship of the calf which the Samiri led them to, Moses' request to his Lord to see Him, Allah's answer, the unconsciousness of Moses and the seventy men, the collapse of the mountain when Allah manifested His Glory to it, Allah's informing Moses that his people had worshipped the calf after him, his return to his people angry and sorrowful, Moses' seizing his brother Aaron by his beard and head, Aaron's apology and plea for compassion, the punishment Moses inflicted upon the Samiri who made the calf, and what Moses did to the Samiri's calf: burning it, grinding it to powder, and scattering it in the sea. In all of this, Allah revealed to His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) the mention of it in His Noble Book, in several places in the Wise Remembrance. To the next chapter, if Allah wills, and peace and the mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you. ### Chapter Fifty-Six Continued: Moses I mentioned at the end of the previous chapter that Allah the Blessed and Most High mentioned in several places in His Noble Book the story of His promise to Moses to give him the Torah, the selection of seventy men from the Children of Israel to go with Moses, what happened to Moses and those with him (the fainting), what happened concerning his people's worship of the calf after his departure to receive the Torah, his return to his people angry and sorrowful, what transpired between Moses and Aaron regarding that, the punishment of the Samiri, and the burning of the calf and scattering it in the sea. In Surah Al-Baqarah, Allah says: *“And when We appointed for Moses forty nights, and then you took the calf [for worship] after him, while you were wrongdoers. Then We forgave you after that so that you might be grateful. And when We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion that you might be guided. And when Moses said to his people: 'O my people! Indeed, you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [for worship]. So turn in repentance to your Creator and kill [the guilty] among yourselves. That will be better for you in the sight of your Creator.' Then He accepted your repentance; indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful. And [remember] when you said, 'O Moses, we will not believe you until we see Allah clearly,' so the thunderbolt seized you while you were looking on. Then We revived you after your death that you might be grateful.”* [Al-Baqarah: 51-56]. And in the same Surah, He says: *“And Moses had already brought you clear proofs. Then you took the calf [for worship] after him, while you were wrongdoers. And [remember] when We took your covenant and raised over you the Mount, [saying], 'Take what We have given you with determination and listen.' They said, 'We have heard and disobeyed.' And they were made to absorb [the worship of] the calf into their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, 'How wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers!'”* [Al-Baqarah: 92-93]. \"Such as the saying of the Most High, mentioning a group of Prophets and Messengers: *“Indeed, We have revealed to you, as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him. And We revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Descendants (the Tribes), Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Book (the Zabur). And [We sent] messengers about whom We have told you before, and messengers about whom We have not told you. And to Moses, Allah spoke directly.”* [An-Nisa: 163-164]. And His saying, the Most High: *“Those messengers - We preferred some of them over others. Among them were those to whom Allah spoke.”* [Al-Baqarah: 253]. And His saying, the Most High: *“O Moses, I have chosen you over the people for My messages and My words. So take what I have given you and be among the grateful.”* [Al-A'raf: 144]. And His saying, the Most High: *“He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus - to establish the religion and not be divided therein.”* [Ash-Shura: 13]. To the next chapter, if Allah wills, and peace and the mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you. * ### Chapter Fifty-Nine Continued: Moses Moses continued to propagate the Light and Guidance that Allah the Most High had revealed to him, the Torah, with the assistance of his brother Aaron, until Allah took the soul of Aaron (may Allah be pleased with him) while they were both in the wandering with the Children of Israel. Moses (peace and prayers be upon him) had performed the Hajj (Pilgrimage) to the Ancient House (the Kaaba) in Mecca. Muslim reported a Hadith from Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by the valley of Al-Azraq and asked: *“What valley is this?”* They said: *“The Valley of Al-Azraq.”* He said: *“It is as if I am looking at Moses, descending from the mountain pass, raising his voice to Allah with the Talbiyah (the pilgrim's chant).”* Then he came to the mountain pass of Harsha and asked: *“What mountain pass is this?”* They said: *“This is the pass of Harsha.”* He said: *“It is as if I am looking at Jonah, son of Matta, on a red she-camel, wearing a wool cloak, the nose-string of his camel made of fiber—meaning palm fiber—while he is reciting the Talbiyah.”* When speaking about Abraham the Close Friend, I mentioned some of the characteristics of Moses: that he was Adam (a dark complexion or tanned), curly-haired, large-bodied, and tall, as if he were one of the men of Azd Shanu'ah. Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported a Hadith from Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) that the Messenger of Allah said: *“On the night of my Ascension (Mi'raj), I saw Moses, son of Imran, a tall, curly-haired man, as if he were one of the men of Shanu'ah.”* Likewise, Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih, via Mujahid, that he heard Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father), and they mentioned the Dajjal (the Antichrist) and that it is written between his eyes 'disbeliever' or (k.f.r.). He said: *“I did not hear him say this, but he said: 'As for Abraham, look at your companion (i.e., Muhammad). As for Moses, he is on a red camel, bridled with palm fibers; it is as if I am looking at him descending into the valley.' ”* However, Moses' death came before he entered the Holy Land. He asked Allah to bring him near the Holy Land at the distance of a stone's throw. Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported in their Sahihs, a Hadith from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Angel of Death was sent to Moses. When the Angel came to him, Moses struck him. The Angel returned to his Lord and said: *“You sent me to a servant who does not want to die.”* Allah said: *“Go back to him and tell him to place his hand on the back of a bull, and he will be granted one year for every hair his hand covers.”* Moses asked: *“O my Lord, then what?”* He replied: *“Then death.”* Moses said: *“Then now (from a close distance)!”* Then he asked Allah to bring him near the Holy Land at the distance of a stone's throw. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Messenger of Allah said: *“If I were there, I would show you his grave beside the road near the red sand dune.”* Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) then said: Ma'mar informed us, from Hammam, who said: Abu Hurayrah narrated to us from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) a similar Hadith. Muslim reported in his Sahih, from Hammam bin Munabbih, who said: This is what Abu Hurayrah narrated to us from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He mentioned several Hadiths, among which the Messenger of Allah said: *“The Angel of Death came to Moses and said to him: 'Answer the call of your Lord.' Moses then slapped the eye of the Angel of Death and blinded it. The Angel returned to Allah the Most High and said: 'You sent me to a servant of Yours who does not want to die, and he has blinded my eye.' Allah restored his eye to him and said: 'Go back to My servant and tell him: Do you want life? If you want life, place your hand on the back of a bull, and you will live for a year for every hair your hand covers.' Moses asked: 'Then what?' He replied: 'Then death.' Moses said: 'Then now, from near! O my Lord, let me die at the distance of a stone's throw from the Holy Land.' ”* The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: *“By Allah, if I were there, I would show you his grave beside the road near the red sand dune.”* Some who claim knowledge have found this Hadith problematic, wondering how Moses could strike the Angel of Death and blind his eye. There is no strangeness in this, because Moses did not know that he was the Angel of Death, just as Abraham, the Close Friend of Allah, did not recognize the angels he hosted, and said to them when they did not eat his food: *“Indeed, we are fearful of you.”* [Hud: 70]. Moreover, Allah the Blessed and Most High does not take the soul of any of His prophets except after giving him the choice. It is reported that no prophet was taken except after being given the choice. That is why when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was given the choice, he chose the Highest Companion. As for the astonishment at the blinding of the Angel's eye, it is based on a definition of angels that their *form is not subject to physical laws*, meaning that if the angel took the form of a man or otherwise, and one intended to kill him or cut off a limb, his form would not be affected by that, and he could not be harmed, unlike the Jinn, whose form is subject to physical laws; if the Jinn takes the form of an animal and that animal is killed, the Jinn is killed. However, since this definition is not established by any authentic narration from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), it is not permissible for a Muslim to reject an authentic and established Hadith from the Messenger of Allah based on it. I have seen many followers of misguided desires who are hostile to the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and to Al-Bukhari, Muslim, and other Imams of the Ahl As-Sunnah wal Jama'ah (People of the Sunnah and the Group) dwell on this authentic Hadith to malign the Companions of the Messenger of Allah and the scholars of Hadith. It is known that there is no doubt about the authenticity of this narration from the Messenger of Allah, the Truthful and Trustworthy. * ### The Distortion of the Torah by the Jews The Jews altered the Torah after Moses. The Torah in their possession consists of five books (sefarim): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus (or the Book of Priests), Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The Jews claim that Moses wrote the Torah with his own hand. However, it is stated in the thirty-fourth chapter of Deuteronomy, paragraph five: *“So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord.”* And in paragraph six: *“And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-Peor; but no one knows his burial place to this day.”* It is thus clear beyond doubt that this book was written after Moses. How could Moses write with his own hand that he died and was buried at Al-Jawa in the land of Moab opposite Beth-Peor, and that no one knows his grave to this day? Further confirming their alteration is what is stated in the thirty-first chapter of Deuteronomy, paragraph 24: *“When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book, to the very end, 25. Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying, 26. 'Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and it will remain there as a witness against you. 27. For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. Even while I am still alive with you today, you have been rebellious against the Lord; how much more after my death! 28. Gather to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth to witness against them. 29. For I know that after my death you will corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way that I have commanded you.' ”* * ### Islam and the Origin of 'Judaism' Judaism is not the religion of Moses; his religion was Islam. The term 'Judaism' is an innovation that emerged after Moses. Therefore, there is no authentic report that Moses called them by this name. The term 'Judaism' could be derived from *'Al-Hawd'* (returning to God), meaning repentance, based on His saying: *“We have returned to You (Hudna Ilayk).”* [Al-A'raf: 156]. It may also be derived from *'Al-Tahwid'*, which is the repetition of sound softly with a trill and melodic embellishment; Jewish scholars used to recite to the public with pronounced melodies and nasalization. Alternatively, it could be a reference to Judah (Yehuda), a leader of the tribes of the Children of Israel, by way of predominance (Taghlib), and its application to all the Children of Israel is based on Judah (with a Dāl) or Yudha (with a Dhāl), as mentioned in Al-Qamus Al-Muhit (The Comprehensive Lexicon). One says *'Yahudhi'* or *'Yahudi'*. The name 'Jews' was never mentioned in the Book of Allah the Most High or in the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in a context of praise whatsoever. Everything reported about them during Moses' time was under the name of the People of the Book, people of Moses, and Children of Israel. The term 'Judaism' was only mentioned in the Book of Allah in a context of blame. And the knowledge rests with Allah. Peace be upon Moses and Aaron, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings.",

  "texte_original":"## Chapter Forty-Three: Al-Yasa' and Dhul-Kifl In this chapter, we discuss two noble Prophets of Allah the Almighty, namely Al-Yasa' (Elisha) and Dhul-Kifl (Ezekiel?), upon whom be peace. Allah the Blessed and Exalted mentioned Al-Yasa' twice in His Book, including him among the Prophets whom Allah granted the argument against their people, and whom He commanded His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to emulate. 1. In Surah Al-An'am (6:83-86, 90): \"That was Our argument, which We gave to Abraham against his people. We raise in degrees whom We will. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing. And We gave to him Isaac and Jacob. All [of them] We guided. And [before that] We guided Noah, and among his descendants, David and Solomon and Ayyub and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the doers of good. And Zechariah and John and Jesus and Elias—all were of the righteous. And Ishmael and Al-Yasa' and Jonah and Lot—and all We favored over the worlds.\" Then He said: \"Those are the ones whom Allah has guided; so take their guidance as an example.\" 2. In Surah Sad (38:48), He mentioned him again among the Prophets whom His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was commanded to emulate in patience against the harm of his people, after saying: \"Be patient over what they say, and remember Our servant David, the man of strength; indeed, he was ever returning [to Allah]\" (38:17); and after narrating David's story, He said: \"And We gave to David, Solomon. An excellent servant, indeed he was ever returning [to Allah]\" (38:30). After Solomon's story, He mentioned Ayyub, who was more severely tested, and said at the end of his story: \"Indeed, We found him patient, an excellent servant. Indeed, he was ever returning [to Allah]\" (38:44). He then mentioned \"Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, owners of power and [religious] vision\" (38:45), and then said: \"And remember Ishmael and Al-Yasa' and Dhul-Kifl, and all were of the outstanding.\" (38:48). Al-Yasa' is a name that could be Hebrew or Arabic. Abu Hayyan, in *Al-Bahr Al-Muhit* regarding the interpretation of Surah Al-An'am, said that the majority of readers recited *Al-Yasa'*, as if *Al* (the definite article) was introduced to an Arabic verb (*wasi'a*). Two readers (Hamzah and Al-Kisa'i) recited *Al-Laysi'* on the pattern of *fay'al*. Scholars differed on whether the name is Arabic or foreign (*'Ajami*). Those who considered it Arabic and followed the majority reading said it is an imperfect verb that was used as a name without a pronoun, was then inflected, and made definite with *Al*. Others said it was named after a verb like *Yazid* (increasing), and *Al* was added exceptionally, like in the phrase *Al-Yazid*. Those who considered it foreign said *Al* was added and became permanent exceptionally, a position supported by Abu Ali Al-Farisi. In any case, the discussion concludes that the most reliable view does not consider *Al* to be inseparable from the name. Abu Hayyan further stated that these foreign names are not declined with the Kasrah nor nunated, except for Al-Yasa', which is declined with the Kasrah but not nunated, and Lot (Lut), which is fully declined (triptote) due to the lightness of its structure, despite possessing the attributes of non-declination (being a proper noun and foreign). The claims that Al-Yasa' was Ibn Akhtub, or the son of the old woman, or that his name was Al-Asbat Ibn 'Adi from the descendants of Joseph, or that he was the cousin of Elias and was hiding with him, or that he succeeded Elias among his people in Banias of the Levant: all these sayings are not based on any authentic proof. What Allah has mentioned about him in His decisive Book is sufficient. And the perfect knowledge is with Allah. As for Dhul-Kifl, Allah the Exalted also mentioned him twice in His Noble Book: 1. In Surah Al-Anbiya (21:85-86), amongst the Messengers after the story of Ayyub, so that the Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would emulate them in patience against the harm of his people. He said: \"And [mention] Ishmael and Idrees and Dhul-Kifl; all were of the patient. And We admitted them into Our mercy. Indeed, they were of the righteous.\" 2. In Surah Sad (38:48), also after the story of Ayyub. He said: \"And remember Our servants Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, owners of power and [religious] vision. Indeed, We chose them for an exclusive quality: remembrance of the home [of the Hereafter]. And indeed, they are near Us among the chosen and the outstanding. And remember Ishmael and Al-Yasa' and Dhul-Kifl, and all were of the outstanding.\" (38:45-48). Some people claimed that Dhul-Kifl was not a Prophet, attributing this rejected opinion to some of the early scholars (*Salaf*), relying on interpolated Israeli accounts (*Isra'iliyyat*), none of which are authentic from the Messenger of Allah. The apparent context of the Glorious Quran proves that he is one of the great Prophets, one of those whom Allah commanded His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to emulate, as he was associated in Surah Al-Anbiya with a group of great Messengers, and in Surah Sad with a group of these Master Messengers, after Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was commanded to be patient by following their example, including Dhul-Kifl. The rule among the *Usuliyyun* (specialists in Islamic legal methodology) is that the principle is to act upon the apparent meaning of the text unless there is evidence to deviate from it, and no authentic evidence exists to prove that Dhul-Kifl was not among the Prophets. As for the narration by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Mujahid, stating that Al-Yasa' appointed a successor and stipulated that he should fast the day, pray the night, and never get angry, and that this man, who was unimpressive to look at, fulfilled the condition: this is among the tales of the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il). Likewise, the report from Ibn Abi Hatim from Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari, who said in a sermon that Dhul-Kifl was not a Prophet, is a narration with a disturbed chain of transmission and carries the known characteristics of *Isra'iliyyat*. As for the Hadith narrated by Imam Ahmad (and classified as *Hasan*—good—by At-Tirmidhi) via Ibn Umar, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"There was a man among the Children of Israel called Al-Kifl who would not refrain from any sin he committed. A needy woman came to him. He gave her sixty Dinars to commit sin with him, but when he sat with her as a man sits with his wife, she wept. He stood up, repented, gave her the Dinars, and died that very night. In the morning, it was written on his door, 'Allah has forgiven Al-Kifl.'\" This Hadith, also narrated by At-Tirmidhi, and which some scholars stopped at Ibn Umar (making it *Mawquf*), is likewise among the fabrications of the Bani Isra'il against the Prophets of Allah. Ibn Kathir said about it in *Qisas Al-Anbiya':* \"It is a very strange Hadith, and there is doubt in its chain of transmission.\" To the next chapter, if Allah wills. Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.",

  "texte_original":"In this chapter, we speak about the Prophet and Messenger of Allah, Isaac, son of Abraham the Friend of Allah (peace be upon them). He was born to Abraham’s second son. Isaac is the blessing through which Allah favored His creation, and his righteous wife was Sarah. Isaac is one of the signs of Allah, born to his mother when she was old and barren, and from him descend all the tribes of the Children of Israel. Abraham had already reached one hundred years of age. The Noble Qur’an mentions Isaac in several places. Allah, exalted and glorified be He, mentioned the good news of his birth when He says in Surah Adh-Dhariyat: \"When the guests of Abraham arrived, he hurried to his family and brought them a fat calf. They said: 'Peace.' He said: 'Peace.' He was relieved regarding them, fearing for them. They said: 'Do not fear, and We give you glad tidings of a knowledgeable boy.'\" [Adh-Dhariyat: 24-30] Allah also says in Surah Hud: \"And indeed, Our messengers came to Abraham with good news. When he saw their hands, which could not reach him, he recognized them as sent to a corrupt people, the people of Lot, and his wife was present. Then she laughed, saying: 'Are we sent to a corrupt people?' They gave her the glad tidings of Isaac and, through him, Jacob.\" [Hud: 69-75] Allah says in Surah Al-Hijr: \"We give you glad tidings of a knowledgeable son. How do you give this news while old age has arrived?\" [Al-Hijr: 51-56] Allah also says in Surah Al-Ankabut: \"When Our messengers came to Abraham with good news, they said: 'We will destroy the inhabitants of this town because they were unjust.' Abraham said: 'But Lot is there.' They said: 'We know best who is in it; We will save him and his family, except his wife who will be among the losers.'\" [Al-Ankabut: 31-32] And Allah says in Surah As-Saffat: \"And We blessed Isaac as a prophet among the righteous, and We blessed his descendants; some were good and others wronged themselves.\" [As-Saffat: 112-113] Allah described Sarah when she received the glad tidings: when she heard the guests of Abraham announce the birth of Isaac, she approached them in astonishment, wondering how she could bear a child at this advanced age to this elderly husband. She covered her face due to the intensity of this news upon her, and Allah says: \"Then his wife approached and covered her face and said: 'How can I bear a child while I am old and barren?'\" [Adh-Dhariyat: 29] Allah also described Sarah as standing and laughing; her laughter was due to joy at the arrival of the guests and the announcement of Isaac’s birth, and the continuation of the lineage through Jacob. She said in astonishment: \"How can I give birth while I am old and this is my husband? This is truly something amazing!\" [Hud: 72] And in the same Surah: \"The mercy and blessings of Allah be upon you, O household. He is indeed praiseworthy and glorious.\" [Hud: 73] This clearly indicates that the wife is part of the household, refuting those who deviate from the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and do not include the wives of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in his household, as Allah says: \"Allah only desires to remove all impurity from the family of the Prophet and to purify them completely.\" [Al-Ahzab: 33] Regarding the birth of Jacob: \"And from Isaac’s descendants, Jacob…\" [Hud: 71] This indicates that she gave birth to a knowledgeable boy who would live and have offspring. Allah is the One who named her son Isaac and her grandson Jacob. This may also indicate that she would live to see her grandson. There is no doubt that Jacob is the son of Isaac, and Allah says: \"Were you present when Jacob was about to die and said to his sons: 'Whom will you worship after me?' They said: 'We will worship your God and the God of your fathers Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac. We are submissive.'\" [Al-Baqara: 133] Abraham is the grandfather, Ishmael is the uncle, Isaac is the father, and all are called ‘father’. Allah also says: \"Thus your Lord will guide you and teach you the interpretation of stories and complete His blessings upon you and upon the descendants of Jacob, as He completed it upon your fathers Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is Knowing and Wise.\" [Yusuf: 6] The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) confirmed that Jacob is the son of Isaac, son of Abraham, as narrated by Al-Bukhari: “Joseph the Noble is the son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham.” Allah describes Jacob in the glad tidings of Isaac as righteous: \"We gave him Isaac and Jacob as gifts, and We made them both righteous and guided them to perform prayer and do good deeds.\" [Al-Anbiya: 72-73] Ibn Abbas and Qatada explain that the term ‘gift’ (nafila) in this verse signifies the child given, Jacob, the son of Isaac. The Qur’an and Sunnah confirm that Jacob is the son of Isaac, son of Abraham (peace be upon them). Allah mentions Isaac among the prophets and messengers, and He says about Abraham: *\"We gave him Isaac and Jacob…\" [Maryam: 49] And He says: \"We revealed to you, as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him; and We revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the tribes, and to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, Solomon, and David, to whom We gave the Psalms. We related their stories to you previously, and some messengers We did not relate to you. Allah spoke to Moses directly. They were messengers, bringing good news and warnings, so that there would be a proof for people after the messengers. Allah is Mighty and Wise.\" [An-Nisa: 163]",

  "texte_original":"David and Solomon We speak here about the two noble Prophets, Messengers, and Kings, David (Dāwūd) and Solomon (Sulaymān), peace and blessings be upon them. The first established mention of David is what Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, recounted concerning David's killing of Goliath (Jālūt) in the war that took place between Saul (Ṭālūt) and Goliath in Palestine. The clear indication from the context of the Holy Qur'an's narration of this war story is that the Children of Israel were fought by a group of polytheists (pagans) who drove them out of their homes and took their children captive. At the head of these pagans was Goliath, may Allah curse him. The Children of Israel were governed by Prophets; whenever a Prophet died, Allah would send them another Prophet to explain the Torah to them, judge among them by it, and clarify what they had altered, distorted, and replaced of the words from their (proper) places, according to His saying, the Most High: 'Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and light. By it, the Prophets who had submitted to Allah's will (i.e., submitted to His command) used to judge those who had become Jews (i.e., those who turned to Judaism), as did the rabbis and the scholars, by that which they were entrusted to preserve of the Book of Allah, and to which they were witnesses.' [Qur'an, Al-Mā'idah: 44]. Al-Bukhārī and Muslim narrated on the authority of Abū Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said: 'The Children of Israel were governed by Prophets; whenever a Prophet perished, another Prophet succeeded him. And indeed, there is no Prophet after me.' Thus, the Prophets of the Children of Israel were like the scholars of the Nation of Muhammad, except that revelation (wahy) was sent down to them. When the war intensified against the Children of Israel, they asked their Prophet to send them a king under whose banner they could fight the enemies of Allah, the pagans. Their Prophet informed them that he feared they would shrink from fighting if it was prescribed for them and would not fulfill their commitment. They said: 'And why should we not fight in the cause of Allah when we have been expelled from our homes and our children?' [Qur'an, Al-Baqarah: 246]—meaning, our lands were seized and our children were taken captive. Their Prophet then informed them that Allah had appointed a king for them from among themselves, who was Saul (Ṭālūt). They objected to this appointment and said: 'How can Allah appoint Ṭālūt as a king over us when none of his forefathers was a king, and we are more deserving of the kingship than him, given that he is poor and of little wealth?' Their Prophet replied to them that Allah had chosen him over you and favored him from among you, and Allah had granted him an abundance in knowledge and physical strength. He is more knowledgeable than you in the affairs of war and the management of matters, and stronger, more patient, and more resilient than you in facing the enemies. Do not object or be stubborn, as you know that it is Allah Who chose and appointed him as your king. Allah gives His kingdom to whom He wills, and Allah is Vast and All-Knowing. Their Prophet also told them: 'Indeed, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, will make for you a sign of the correctness of Ṭālūt's kingship over you, which is the return of the Ark (Tabūt) containing some relics of Moses (Mūsā) and Aaron (Hārūn). You were unable to retrieve it from the hands of its usurpers, and you will not be required to exert effort in recovering it. Rather, the Ark will come, borne by the angels, containing reassurance for the Children of Israel, and a clear indication that nothing is impossible for Allah in the heavens or on the earth. Believe therefore in the promise of Allah, hasten to obey Ṭālūt, and have faith in what I have informed you of from Allah. When they submitted to this and prepared to fight Goliath and his troops under the banner of Ṭālūt, David was among them. Ṭālūt informed them that Allah would test them by a river they would pass while thirsty, and he forbade them from drinking from it, as army leaders know that drinking from it would harm them. Surprisingly, even today, some still forbid their soldiers from drinking during their march toward the enemy, due to the health damage that might result. However, they allow them to wet their throats with a single scoop by hand lightly. Therefore, Ṭālūt permitted his army to take a scoop to wet their throats, considering it not (actual) drinking. This was a manifestation of Ṭālūt's comprehensive knowledge. He warned them, the enemies of Allah, that whoever drank from this river would not accompany him in fighting and would not cross the river. However, when this army reached the river, they disobeyed Ṭālūt and drank from it, except for a small number of them who obeyed Ṭālūt. It is reported in some authentic narrations that those who crossed the river with Ṭālūt were three hundred and a few dozen men, the exact number of the companions of the Messenger of Allah on the Day of Badr. Al-Bukhārī reported in his Sahīh on the authority of Al-Barā' ibn 'Āzib, who said: 'The Companions of Muhammad who witnessed Badr told me that they were the number of Ṭālūt's companions who crossed the river with him: three hundred and a few dozen.' Al-Barā' added: 'Nay, by Allah, none crossed the river with him except a believer.' In another wording in Al-Bukhārī, on the authority of Al-Barā', he said: 'We, the Companions of Muhammad, used to talk about the fact that the number of the companions of Badr was the same as the number of Ṭālūt's companions who crossed the river with him, and none crossed with him except a believer: three hundred and a few dozen.' In another wording in Al-Bukhārī, on the authority of Al-Barā', he said: 'We used to talk about the companions of Badr being three hundred and a few dozen, the same number as Ṭālūt's companions who crossed the river with him, and none crossed with him except a believer.' When Ṭālūt and those who believed with him crossed the river, they found that their enemy, Goliath, had amassed troops and prepared immense equipment. Some of the believers among Ṭālūt's companions said: 'We have no strength or power today to fight this numerous enemy,' as if they underestimated themselves in facing their foe. Their scholars, who knew that Allah's promise is true and that victory comes from Allah, not from the multitude of numbers or the strength of equipment, encouraged them, stating that a Muslim should desire martyrdom and meeting Allah in His cause, saying to them: 'How many a small company has overcome a large company by permission of Allah! And Allah is with the patient.' And when they advanced to meet Goliath and his troops [Qur'an, Al-Baqarah: 249-250], they asked Allah to send down patience upon them, to make their feet firm in the encounter with the enemies, and to grant them victory over the disbelieving people. Allah answered their prayer and granted them victory over their enemies. David killed Goliath, their king. Ṭālūt hastened to relinquish the kingship to David. Allah sent David as a Prophet and Messenger, and made him a noble King over the Children of Israel. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, praised Ṭālūt and described him with noble attributes. As for what some exegetes and chroniclers alleged, that Ṭālūt envied David, was afflicted with madness, and wandered in the desert, this is a baseless claim with no proof from an authentic report. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, mentioned the story of Ṭālūt, his war against Goliath, and the conferral of kingship upon David, where He said: 'Have you not considered the assembly of the Children of Israel after [the time of] Moses, when they said to a prophet of theirs, “Appoint for us a king, and we will fight in the cause of Allah.” He said, “Would you perhaps refrain from fighting if fighting was prescribed for you?” They said, “And why should we not fight in the cause of Allah when we have been expelled from our homes and our children?” But when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers. And their prophet said to them, “Indeed, Allah has sent to you Ṭālūt as a king.” They said, “How can he have kingship over us while we are more deserving of kingship than him and he has not been given a great amount of wealth?” He said, “Indeed, Allah has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and body. And Allah gives His sovereignty to whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing [in favor] and Knowing.” And their prophet said to them, “Indeed, the sign of his kingship is that the Ark (Tabūt) will come to you in which is assurance from your Lord and a remnant of what the family of Moses and the family of Aaron left, carried by the angels. Indeed, in that is a sign for you, if you are believers.” And when Ṭālūt set out with the soldiers, he said, “Indeed, Allah will be testing you with a river. So whoever drinks from it is not of me, and whoever does not taste it is indeed of me, excepting one who takes [just] a scoop with his hand.” But they drank from it, except for a few of them. Then when he crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said, “There is no power for us today against Goliath and his soldiers.” But those who were certain that they would meet Allah said, “How many a small company has overcome a large company by permission of Allah! And Allah is with the patient.” And when they advanced to meet Goliath and his soldiers, they said, “Our Lord, pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people.” So they defeated them by permission of Allah, and David killed Goliath. And Allah gave him the kingship and wisdom and taught him of that which He willed. And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, the earth would have been corrupted. But Allah is the possessor of favor over the worlds. These are the verses of Allah which We recite to you in truth, and indeed, you are among the messengers.' [Qur'an, Al-Baqarah: 246-252]. To the next chapter, if Allah wills, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Sixty-One The True Stories of the Prophets Continuation of David and Solomon After Allah established David in the land, gave him kingship and prophethood, revealed the Zabur (Psalms) to him, and taught him the upright methodology that he and the Children of Israel needed, Allah made the reading of the Zabur easy for David and lightened it for him to the extent that he would read it in the time it took to saddle his mounts, as was reported by the Truthful, the Confirmed, the Infallible one who does not speak from (his own) desire: Muhammad. Al-Bukhārī reported in his Sahīh on the authority of Abū Hurayrah that the Prophet said: 'The recitation (of the Qur'an\/Zabur) was made easy for David. He would order his mounts to be saddled, and he would finish reading the Qur'an (the Zabur) before his mounts were saddled. And he would only eat from the work of his own hands.' The term 'Qur'an' (Recitation) here refers to the Zabur which Allah revealed to David, as He says: 'And to David We gave the Zabur.' [Qur'an, An-Nisā': 163]. 'Qur'an' is also used to refer to the recitation, meaning the reading of the Zabur. David had been granted by Allah a beautiful voice with which he would sing and chant as he read the Zabur. The Messenger of Allah described his chanting of the Zabur as having the sound of the pipes (*mizāmīr*). Al-Bukhārī and Muslim reported on the authority of Abū Mūsā Al-Ash'arī that the Messenger of Allah said to him: 'O Abū Mūsā, you have been given a pipe (*mizmār*) from the pipes of the family of David.' Ahmad reported in his Musnad: 'Abdul Razzāq narrated to us, who said: Ma'mar narrated to us, from Az-Zuhrī, from 'Urwah, from 'Ā’ishah, who said: The Messenger of Allah heard the voice of Abū Mūsā Al-Ash'arī while he was reciting and said: 'Abū Mūsā has been given a pipe from the pipes of the family of David.' David was committed to eating only from the work of his own hands, and he adopted a method in fasting and prayer that was the most beloved method which the Messenger of Allah encouraged for supererogatory acts. It is confirmed in the two Sahīh that the Messenger of Allah said: 'The most beloved prayer to Allah is the prayer of David, and the most beloved fasting to Allah is the fasting of David. He would sleep half the night, stand in prayer for a third of it, and sleep a sixth of it. And he would fast one day and break his fast one day, and he would not flee when he met (the enemy).' In a wording in Al-Bukhārī on the authority of 'Abdullāh ibn 'Amr, he said: The Messenger of Allah said to me: 'The most beloved fasting to Allah is the fasting of David: he would fast one day and break his fast one day. And the most beloved prayer to Allah is the prayer of David: he would sleep half the night, stand in prayer for a third of it, and sleep a sixth of it.' Al-Bukhārī also reported in his Sahīh on the authority of Al-Miqdād ibn Ma'dīkarib that the Messenger of Allah said: 'No one has ever eaten a food better than that which he eats from the work of his own hands. And the Prophet of Allah, David, used to eat from the work of his own hands.' Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, favored David by softening iron for him and teaching him the craft of making protective clothing (armor) for the believing fighters. He was the first to make the coats of mail, which may be called *az-zard*. Allah guided him to the optimal method for making them, by making them in rings after they had been plates, to make their use easy. He commanded him to make them full-length (*sābighāt*), covering the entire body of the wearer and dragging on the ground, and suitable for different body sizes, long and wide, so that their benefit would extend to all fighters. He also ordered him to be precise in the linkage (*as-sard*), meaning in the weaving of the armor, which is the interlocking of the rings, and not to make the rivets thick, which would break the ring, nor thin, which would make them loose, nor to increase their durability such that they become heavy for the fighter. This is a great blessing for which Allah drew the attention of the believers to the obligation of thanking Him, as He says: 'Will you then be grateful?' [Qur'an, Al-Anbiyā': 80]. Allah also subjected the mountains and birds to David: whenever he glorified Allah, they glorified Allah with him. He gave him wisdom and decisive speech. Concerning all of this, Allah says in Sūrah Al-Anbiyā': 'And We subjected the mountains to glorify with David, and the birds. And We were the doers. And We taught him the making of coats of mail for you, to protect you from your [mutual] violence. Will you then be grateful?' [Qur'an, Al-Anbiyā': 79-80]. And He says in Sūrah Saba': 'And certainly, We gave David a favor from Us. “O mountains, repeat [Our praises] with him, and [O] birds.” And We made the iron soft for him, [commanding him], “Make full coats of mail and measure the links [of the chain] accurately. And work righteousness. Indeed, I am Seeing of what you do.”' [Qur'an, Saba': 10-11]. And He says in Sūrah Ṣād, commanding the Master of the Messengers, Muhammad, to follow David's example in patience: 'Be patient over what they say and remember Our servant David, the man of strength; indeed, he was one who often turned back [to Allah]. Indeed, We subjected the mountains [to praise] with him, glorifying [Allah] in the evening and the sunrise. And the birds assembled, all with him oft-returning [to Allah]. And We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and decisive speech.' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 17-20]. The Jews fabricated many lies about David, just as they lied about the Prophets of Allah before and after him, and even killed some of the Prophets. They claimed that David went out one evening to walk on the roof of the royal palace, where he saw a beautiful woman bathing. He sent men to fetch her and bring her to him. She came to him, and he lay with her, and she conceived from him. He then worked to have her husband killed. It is stated in the eleventh chapter of the Second Book of Samuel, which they possess, in paragraph two: 'And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.' In paragraph three: 'And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?' In paragraph four: 'And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.' According to paragraph five: 'And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.' After the Second Book of Samuel narrates David's attempt to get rid of Uriah, the woman's husband, and sending him to war to be killed, the book says in paragraph 26: 'And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.' And in paragraph 27: 'And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord.' The book then continues to narrate the Lord's reproach of David, the death of the child Bathsheba bore, then David's repentance and fasting, and finally his entry to Uriah's wife and lying with her, whereupon she conceived and bore a son named Solomon. The astonishing and strange thing is that this falsehood deceived some who claim knowledge of exegesis (Tafsīr), and they used it to interpret Allah's saying: 'Has there come to you the news of the disputants, when they scaled the wall of the prayer chamber (Mihrab)? When they entered upon David, he was alarmed by them. They said, “Fear not. [We are] two disputants; one of us has wronged the other, so judge between us with truth and do not exceed [it] and guide us to the sound path. Indeed, this [man] is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes (na'jah), and I have one ewe, and he said, ‘Entrust her to me,’ and he overpowered me in the speech.” [David] said, “He has certainly wronged you by demanding your ewe [to be added] to his ewes. And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds—and few are those.” And David realized that We had tried him, so he asked forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing [in prostration] and repented. So We forgave him that, and indeed, for him is nearness to Us and a beautiful place of return.' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 21-25]. Interpreting these verses to mean that David fell in love with Uriah's wife, forced him to give her up, and sought to have him killed until he was killed, while David had ninety-nine women and Uriah only this one woman, and that two angels came in the form of disputants to warn David of the ugliness of his deed: I say that this interpretation of these noble verses is void, false, corrupt, and worthless; it is a fabricated and innovated slander that common folk and riff-raff would reject for themselves, and a concocted Jewish plot that ears despise and natures reject. Therefore, it is reported that 'Alī (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 'Whoever tells you the story of David as narrated by the storytellers, flog him one hundred and sixty times,' which is the prescribed penalty for slander against the Prophets. It is also reported that a righteous man of knowledge was sitting with 'Umar ibn 'Abdul 'Azīz in the Mosque, and near them was a man narrating this fabricated story about David to the people. The righteous man said: 'O man, if the matter is contrary to what you claim, you have slandered the Prophet of Allah, David. And if the matter is as you claim, and Allah concealed His Prophet David by metaphorically saying *'na'jah'* (ewe) and did not say 'woman,' then it is not lawful for you to expose the Prophet of Allah, David.' 'Umar ibn 'Abdul 'Azīz said: 'This statement is dearer to me than everything the sun has risen upon.' To the next chapter, if Allah wills, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Sixty-Two The True Stories of the Prophets Continuation of David and Solomon I mentioned at the end of the previous chapter that the interpretation of those who explained the saying of the Most High: 'Has there come to you the news of the disputants, when they scaled the wall of the prayer chamber (Mihrab)?' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 21] up to His saying: 'and fell down bowing [in prostration] and repented.' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 24], by saying that David fell in love with Uriah's wife, forced him to give her up, and sought to have him killed until he was killed, and the interpretation of the 'ewe' (*na'jah*) in the verse as the 'woman,' I said that this interpretation is void, false, corrupt, and worthless, a fabricated and innovated slander that common folk and riff-raff would reject for themselves, and a Jewish plot that ears despise and natures reject. I mention here that the context of the Qur'an refutes it. Indeed, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, mentioned in the introduction of this Surah, up to His saying: 'and they said, “Our Lord, hasten for us our share [of the punishment] before the Day of Account.”' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 16], the harm suffered by the Messenger of Allah from his people, their collusion against him, and their ridicule of him. So, Allah commanded him to be patient over what they said, and commanded him to remember the story of the righteous and oft-returning servant, David, then the story of Solomon, and then the story of Job (Ayyūb), and the distress they suffered, for which they were patient, and then relief came to them from Allah. It is well-known that the Glorious Qur'an is like a well-arranged string of pearls: every verse is completely linked to what precedes it and what follows it. So, would Allah command His Messenger Muhammad to be patient, following the example of David, the righteous and oft-returning servant, and then describe this oft-returning one as the lover who craves the wife of a believing man who has no other, while David had ninety-nine women? That is indeed an abominable saying and a falsehood. Rather, Allah commands His Messenger Muhammad in these verses to be patient regarding the harm from his people, and reminds him of what happened to his brother, the righteous and oft-returning servant David, when disputants scaled the wall of his Mihrab—meaning his palace—and he was alarmed by them, fearing they would assassinate him. When they reassured him that they had not come to harm him but as disputants, the claimant stepped forward, pointed to the defendant, and said: 'Indeed, this [man] is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes (*na'jah*, meaning a domestic sheep), and I have one ewe, and he was kind to me at first when he saw me tending her alone, and he asked me to put her with his ewes to graze with them without any difficulty for me. But after a period of time, when I came to claim her, he denied my right to her, oppressed me, rejected the claim, and claimed she was his property.' When David heard the claimant and asked the defendant, who denied what the claimant was saying, David judged in favor of the claimant: 'He has certainly wronged you by demanding your ewe [to be added] to his ewes. And this is the custom of those who mingle (partners) who do not fear Allah, unlike the righteous believers, who are few.' When they departed, satisfied with his judgment, David reproached himself for being alarmed by them, and thought that he had been tested by his fear of them scaling the Mihrab. So, he fell down bowing and repented, and Allah forgave what happened from him. It is as if Allah, the Most High, is saying to the Master of the Messengers, the Imam of the pious, and the Chief of the men of resolution, Muhammad: 'Beware of being alarmed by the threats of Quraysh, and remember the story of your brother, the righteous and oft-returning servant David, when disputants scaled the wall of his Mihrab and he was alarmed by them; so he apologized to Allah for this alarm, thinking it was not befitting for the Prophets and Messengers. You are more deserving of not being alarmed by Quraysh, no matter how much they collude against you and threaten you, for the good outcome in this world and the Hereafter is for you, and Allah will protect you from the people.' The story of David in Sūrah Ṣād contains no mention of a woman, love, passion, or aggression against the wife of a believing man under the protection of her husband. Rather, it mentions the 'ewe' (*na'jah*). The Arabs—as I mentioned in the introduction to this book, Stories of the Prophets, in the second chapter—do not call a woman a *na'jah*. The term *na'jah* is applied to the female sheep or the wild cow (*baqar al-waḥsh*). It is used only for comparison, and a woman would never be pleased to be compared to a female sheep, but she would be pleased to be compared to the wild cows of Al-Falā, meaning the wild cow. If she is compared to the female sheep, what is meant is the Oryx (*al-Mahā*), which is the wild cow, as the poet said about two women: *'Statues of Hakar, they are two ewes from the ewes of Tabālah, near two fawns, or nearly.'* Tabālah is a place between Bīshah and An-Numāṣ where many wild cows were found, and *ju'dharayn* is the dual of *ju'dhar*, which is the fawn of the wild cow. *Dumā Hakar* means statues made of marble, and Hakar is a place containing these statues, or it is said to be a Roman monastery or a palace. Thus, the woman rejoices if she is compared to the wild cow for the beauty of her eyes and the beauty of her neck. That is why the poet said: *'The eyes of the Oryx (Al-Mahā) are between Ar-Raṣāfah and Al-Jisr.'* And another said: *'Indeed, the eyes with the corner-beauty (ḥawar) brought passion from where I know not. They killed us, and they do not revive our slain. They strike down the intelligent man until he has no movement, yet they are the weakest creatures of Allah as human beings.'* It is well-known that the wild cow does not graze under the care of a shepherd. Thus, applying the term *na'jah* to a woman is not standard Arabic usage; it is only by way of comparison to the wild cow, not the female sheep. Abū Ḥayyān, in his famous Tafsīr (*Al-Baḥr Al-Muḥīṭ*), concerning the saying of the Most High: 'Indeed, this [man] is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes, and I have one ewe.' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 23], said: 'The apparent meaning is to keep the word *na'jah* in its literal sense, as being a female sheep, and it is not a metaphor for a woman, nor is there any necessity for it.' Then Abū Ḥayyān said: 'What I adhere to is what the apparent meaning of the verse indicates: that the people who scaled the Mihrab were humans who entered by an unusual entrance, and outside the time David sat for judgment, and that he was alarmed by them, thinking they would assassinate him, as he was alone in his Mihrab for the worship of his Lord. When it became clear to him that they had come for a judgment and two of them stepped forward for arbitration, as Allah recounted, David thought that their entry at that time and from that direction was a trial from Allah. What he feared did not happen, so he sought forgiveness for that thought. That is why Allah referred to it with His saying: 'So We forgave him that,' and nothing preceded it except His saying: 'And David realized that We had tried him.' It is definitely known that the Prophets are infallible (*ma'ṣūmūn*) from sins, and it is impossible for them to commit anything of the sort. If we were to permit any such thing for them, the religious laws would be invalidated, and we would not trust anything they report that Allah revealed to them... End quote. As for Al-Bukhārī's statement in his Book of the Stories of the Prophets in his Sahīh: 'A woman is called *na'jah* (ewe), and she is also called *shāh* (sheep\/goat),' Al-Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajar, in *Fatḥ Al-Bārī*, indicated that he derived this from Abū 'Ubaydah Ma'mar ibn Al-Muthannā, who said: Abū 'Ubaydah said concerning His saying: 'and I have one ewe,' meaning a woman. Al-A'shā said: *'And I shot the unawareness of her eye about her sheep, and I hit the kernel of her heart and her spleen.'* It is known that Abū 'Ubaydah Ma'mar ibn Al-Muthannā interpreted some words in the Qur'an as being metaphorical (*majāz al-Qur'ān*). Many Imams criticized him for this path. He is not considered among the trustworthy narrators of reports. Al-A'shā's use of the word *shāh* for a woman was actually a comparison of the woman to the wild cow. Al-Ḥāfiẓ Adh-Dhahabī said in *Tadhkirat Al-Ḥuffāẓ* when mentioning Abū 'Ubaydah Ma'mar ibn Al-Muthannā: 'He is not a scholar of Hadith; rather, it was a slip of my pen to write his name.' Ibn Kathīr said in the story of David from *Al-Bidāyah wan-Nihāyah*: 'Many exegetes, from the predecessors and successors, have mentioned here stories and reports, most or all of which are *Isra’iliyyāt* (Judeo-Christian tales), and some of which are undoubtedly false. We have deliberately omitted reporting them in our book, contenting ourselves with merely reciting the story from the Glorious Qur'an. And Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path.' And he said in his Tafsīr after quoting the verses: 'The exegetes have mentioned here a story, most of which is taken from the *Isra’iliyyāt*, and no authentic Hadith from the infallible Prophet that must be followed has been established concerning it. However, Ibn Abī Ḥātim reported here a Hadith whose chain of transmission is not authentic, because it is narrated by Yazīd Ar-Raqāshī from Anas, and although Yazīd was a righteous man, he is weak in Hadith according to the Imams. It is therefore better to confine oneself to the mere recitation of this story and to refer the knowledge of it to Allah.' To the next chapter, if Allah wills, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Sixty-Three The True Stories of the Prophets Continuation: David and Solomon Allah, the Most High, bestowed upon David abundant favor: He gave him kingship and wisdom, and taught him what He willed. He granted him the righteous servant, the noble king, and the great Prophet, the oft-returning (to God): Solomon, son of David. Solomon grew up in the care of David and was raised in the household of prophethood and kingship. When he reached maturity, Allah filled him with clemency (*ḥilm*), meaning patience and reason. He was keen to attend the judicial sittings of his father David to witness his judgments among the people. He would sometimes suggest to his father that if he were the judge in that case, he would have ruled differently than his father had. The Glorious Qur'an mentioned one instance of these cases. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, mentioned in Sūrah Al-Anbiyā' the case of the field (the harvest) when the people's sheep scattered in it (*nafasat*), meaning they spread out in it at night without a shepherd and damaged the crops. It is mentioned that David judged the owners of the sheep to pay the value (of the crops) to the owner of the field. Solomon said: 'If I had been the judge, I would have ruled differently.' His father David asked: 'How would you judge, my son?' He replied: 'I would give the sheep to the owners of the field so they could benefit from their milk and benefits, and the owners of the sheep would be responsible for repairing the field until it returned to its original state. Then, the field would be returned to its owners, and the sheep would be returned to their owners.' Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, favored Solomon's judgment and mentioned that He made him understand the judgment in this case. This does not diminish the status of David, for his joy at his son's success in judgment was no less than his joy would have been had he understood it himself. Therefore, Allah praised David and Solomon together, saying: 'And to each [of them] We gave judgment and knowledge.' Thus, David's judgment here was not an error, but Solomon's judgment in this case was preferable. Concerning this, Allah says: 'And [mention] David and Solomon, when they judged concerning the field, when the sheep of a people pastured therein by night; and We were witnesses to their judgment. And We gave understanding of the case to Solomon, and to each [of them] We gave judgment and knowledge.' [Qur'an, Al-Anbiyā': 78-79]. Ibn Kathīr (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsīr of this verse: 'As for the Prophets, they are all infallible, and there is no disagreement among the confirmed scholars, predecessors and successors, that they are supported by Allah.' As for others, it is confirmed in the Sahīh of Al-Bukhārī on the authority of 'Amr ibn Al-'Āṣ that the Messenger of Allah said: 'When a judge makes an independent legal decision (*ijtihād*) and is correct, he receives two rewards; and when he makes an independent legal decision and is mistaken, he receives one reward.' The Messenger of Allah also narrated another instance of David's judgment, where Solomon showed that he would have ruled differently if he had been the judge. Al-Bukhārī and Muslim reported in their Sahīh on the authority of Abū Hurayrah that he heard the Messenger of Allah say: 'There were two women with their two sons. A wolf came and took the son of one of them. The other said to her companion: “It only took your son.” The other replied: “Nay, it took your son.” They referred their dispute to David, who judged in favor of the elder one. They left and presented themselves to Solomon, son of David, and informed him. Solomon said: “Bring me a knife, and I will divide him between the two of you.” The younger one said: “Do not do that, may Allah have mercy on you! He is her son.” So he judged it to the younger one.' David continued his rule and kingship as long as Allah willed. When death reached him, Allah sent Solomon and made him a noble king and a great Messenger, taught him the language of the birds, and made him one of the Imams of the Messengers whom His Messenger Muhammad was commanded to follow as an example. The Qur'an began by mentioning David and Solomon after Noah (Nūḥ) in Sūrah Al-An'ām, where He says: 'And that was Our [conclusive] argument which We gave to Abraham against his people. We raise in degrees whom We will. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing. And We gave to him Isaac and Jacob. All [of them] We guided. And Noah, We guided before; and among his descendants, David and Solomon, Job and Joseph, Moses and Aaron. And thus do We reward the doers of good.' [Qur'an, Al-An'ām: 83-84]. After mentioning a group of Messengers, He said to His beloved Muhammad: 'Those are the ones whom Allah has guided; so follow their guidance. Say, [O Muhammad], “I ask of you for it no payment. It is not but a reminder to the worlds.” Those are the ones to whom We gave the Scripture and the authority and the prophethood. If they disbelieve in it, then We have entrusted it to a people who are not disbelievers in it.' [Qur'an, Al-An'ām: 89-90]. That is why the Messenger of Allah prostrated when he read Sūrah Ṣād, the prostration of David. Al-Bukhārī reported in his Sahīh on the authority of Mujāhid, who said: 'I asked Ibn 'Abbās about the prostration in Ṣād: “Why do we prostrate?” He said: “Do you not read: 'And among his descendants, David and Solomon... Those are the ones whom Allah has guided; so follow their guidance...' [Qur'an, Al-An'ām: 84-90]? David was among those whom your Prophet was commanded to follow as an example. David prostrated, so your Prophet prostrated.”' Regarding Solomon's succession to his father in kingship and prophethood, Allah says in Sūrah An-Naml: 'And We certainly gave to David and Solomon knowledge, and they said, “Praise to Allah, who has favored us over many of His believing servants.” And Solomon inherited David and said, “O people, we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from all things. Indeed, this is the manifest favor.”' [Qur'an, An-Naml: 15-16]. The inheritance meant here is the inheritance of kingship and prophethood, not the inheritance of wealth. It is reported in the two Sahīh that the Messenger of Allah said: 'We, the company of Prophets, do not pass on inheritance. What we leave is charity (*ṣadaqah*).' Just as the Jews lied about David and fabricated many things about him, they exaggerated in lying about Solomon and followed the devils (*shayāṭīn*) in that. They claimed that Solomon judged by means of his magic ring and that he was a sorcerer. They claimed that when he entered the privy, he would give the ring to his wife because it contained the mention of Allah, until he came out. And that a devil came to Solomon's wife in the form of Solomon, and she gave him the ring. The devil went and sat on the royal throne, judging among the Children of Israel. When Solomon came out of the privy, he asked his wife for the ring, and she said: 'Solomon left before you and took it,' and she did not recognize Solomon. Solomon wandered aimlessly until he worked for a fisherman. The fisherman would give him two fish as his daily wage. He would sell one fish to buy bread and cook the other fish. He continued this for forty days. Then the Children of Israel rose up against this devil sitting on Solomon's throne. The devil fled from them—and I do not know why the ring was of no use to him—and threw the ring into the sea. A fish swallowed it, and then it fell into the fisherman's net. When the fisherman gave Solomon his two fish as payment, he sold one and cooked the other, which had the ring inside it. When he opened it, he found his ring, put it on, and returned to his kingdom. It is strange that this slander infiltrated some of the great scholars who believed it, to the extent that you find in most books of Tafsīr regarding His saying: 'and We cast upon his chair a body (jasad).' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 34], they say it was a devil. The mention of Solomon's ring and its properties has spread among the common people and the elite, even though Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, warned in Sūrah Al-Baqarah about the lies of the Jews against Solomon by following the devils in this regard, saying: 'And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. And Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic.' [Qur'an, Al-Baqarah: 102], etc. Yet, the Messenger of Allah explained Solomon's trial and the casting of the body upon his chair: He swore that he would go around one hundred of his wives that night, so that each of them would conceive a knight carrying arms and fighting in the cause of Allah. He forgot to say: 'If Allah wills.' He went around them, but only one of them conceived and gave birth to half a child, which was taken and cast upon his chair. He then sought forgiveness from Allah, and Allah accepted his excuse, for he did not seek the child out of arrogance or boasting, but so that they might fight in the cause of Allah. Allah accepted his excuse and substituted for him the wind: 'So We subjected to him the wind, running by his command wherever he directed. And [also] the devils [of jinn]—all builders and divers. And others bound in shackles. [We said], “This is Our gift; so grant [it] or withhold, without reckoning.”' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 36-38]. To the next chapter, if Allah wills, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Sixty-Four The True Stories of the Prophets Continuation of David and Solomon I mentioned at the end of the chapter that the Messenger of Allah explained the saying of the Most High: 'And We certainly tried Solomon and cast upon his chair a body; then he repented.' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 34] with the story of his oath to go around one hundred of his wives so that each of them would conceive and give birth to a knight fighting in the cause of Allah, and he forgot to say: 'If Allah wills.' He went around them, but only one of them conceived and gave birth to half a child, which was taken and cast upon his chair. Al-Bukhārī and Muslim reported in their Sahīh on the authority of Abū Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said: 'Solomon, son of David, said: “I will go around one hundred women tonight, and every woman will give birth to a boy who will fight in the cause of Allah.” He forgot to say: “If Allah wills.” He went around them, but none of the women gave birth except one who gave birth to half a person.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'If he had said: “If Allah wills,” he would not have broken his oath, and he would have achieved his need.' In a wording in Al-Bukhārī: 'She bore nothing except one who was half-formed (sāqiṭ).' The Prophet said: 'If he had said it, they would have fought in the cause of Allah.' So, I am astonished how some scholars abandoned this established explanation from the Messenger of Allah concerning Solomon's trial and instead brought the lies of the Jews and the devils. Ibn Kathīr said in the Stories of the Prophets from *Al-Bidāyah wan-Nihāyah* concerning His saying: 'And We certainly tried Solomon and cast upon his chair a body; then he repented.' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 34]: Ibn Jarīr, Ibn Abī Ḥātim, and others among the exegetes mentioned here many reports from a group of the Salaf (predecessors), and most or all of them are derived from the *Isra’iliyyāt*, and many of them contain severe anomaly. We have drawn attention to this in our book of Tafsīr, and here we have contented ourselves with mere recitation. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, favored Solomon by granting him many sources of strength and compensating him with strength exceeding one hundred fighting sons. He subjected to him: 'the wind, running by his command wherever he directed. And [also] the devils [of jinn]—all builders and divers. And others bound in shackles. [We said], “This is Our gift; so grant [it] or withhold, without reckoning.”' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 36-39]. Just as Allah honored Solomon's status in this world, He prepared for him a high rank and a beautiful place of return in the Hereafter. Concerning this, Allah, the Most High, says: 'And We certainly tried Solomon and cast upon his chair a body; then he repented. He said, “My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom such as will not belong to anyone after me. Indeed, You are the Bestower.” So We subjected to him the wind, running by his command wherever he directed. And [also] the devils [of jinn]—all builders and divers. And others bound in shackles. [We said], “This is Our gift; so grant [it] or withhold, without reckoning.” And indeed, for him is nearness to Us and a beautiful place of return.' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 34-40]. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, described the wind He subjected to Solomon in a way that implies it was subject to Solomon's will: if he wanted it to be gentle and calm, it became so, and if he wanted it to be stormy, fierce, and fast, it was so. It covered in the morning journey (*ghadāh*), meaning from the start of the day until noon, a distance that would take a month of normal travel to cover, and it covered in the afternoon journey (*rawāḥ*), meaning from noon until sunset, a distance that would take a month of normal travel to cover, approximately four hundred eighty miles for the morning journey and the same for the evening journey. All of this is referred to in His saying in Sūrah Ṣād: 'So We subjected to him the wind, running by his command wherever he directed.' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 36], and His saying in Sūrah Al-Anbiyā': 'And to Solomon [We subjected] the tempestuous wind, running by his command toward the land which We had blessed. And We are of all things Knowing.' [Qur'an, Al-Anbiyā': 81], and His saying in Sūrah Saba': 'And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind—its morning journey was a month [of travel] and its evening journey was a month [of travel].' [Qur'an, Saba': 12]. Just as He made iron soft for David, He made the spring of molten copper flow for Solomon, meaning He liquefied the spring of copper and iron for him, so that copper and iron flowed from its mine like a running spring of water, without needing to light a fire on it, to ease his task and increase his strength. He also subjected to him the devils (*shayāṭīn*), who are the rebellious jinn and those beneath them. They worked before him by the command of their Lord, subservient; not one of them dared to flee from serving Solomon, fearing God's swift punishment. They made for Solomon what he wished: *maḥārīb*—meaning high, smooth palaces (of glass)—for the *miḥrāb* is the palace. Applying this term to what is known as the *Qiblah* (niche) in the wall of the mosque to indicate it is a modern usage not known to the Arabs, and it is a grave error to cite the saying of the Most High: 'Every time Zechariah entered upon her in the Mihrab (chamber), he found with her provision.' [Qur'an, Al 'Imrān: 37] for these niches, as they are not intended by this noble verse. The jinn also made for Solomon what he wished in the form of statues (*tamāthīl*), meaning wall decorations of images of trees, flowers, and the like. They also made large bowls as big as cisterns in which food was served. They also made for him fixed cooking pots that could not be moved from their place due to their size. The jinn also performed diving work to extract jewels. Concerning all of this, Allah says in Sūrah Al-Anbiyā': 'And among the devils were those who dived for him and did other work than that; and We were for them Keepers.' [Qur'an, Al-Anbiyā': 82]. And He says in Sūrah Saba': 'And We caused to flow for him a spring of [molten] copper. And of the jinn were those who worked before him by the permission of his Lord. And whoever deviated among them from Our command—We will make him taste of the punishment of the Blaze. They made for him what he willed of elevated chambers (maḥārīb) and statues and bowls like reservoirs and firmly fixed cooking pots. [We said], “Work, O family of David, in gratitude.” And few of My servants are grateful.' [Qur'an, Saba': 12-13]. And He says in Sūrah Ṣād: 'And [also] the devils [of jinn]—all builders and divers. And others bound in shackles. [We said], “This is Our gift; so grant [it] or withhold, without reckoning.” And indeed, for him is nearness to Us and a beautiful place of return.' [Qur'an, Ṣād: 37-40]. Just as Allah subjected the birds to David, gathered and returning (to God) and glorifying Allah with his glorification, He likewise subjected the birds to Solomon, who would gather them whenever he willed and knew their language and the languages of insects. Concerning this, Allah says in Sūrah An-Naml: 'And Solomon inherited David and said, “O people, we have been taught the language of birds.”",

  "texte_original":"Yunus ibn Matta In this chapter, we speak to you about the Prophet and Messenger of Allah, Dhun-Nun, Yunus ibn Matta (Jonah, son of Amittai), peace and blessings be upon him. Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, sent Yunus to the people of Nineveh, from Mosul in Iraq. He called them to Allah Alone and to abandon the worship of everything besides Him. He offered them advice and delivered his Lord's message. Since Yunus was not one of the Messengers of Firm Resolve (Ulul-'Azm min al-Rusul), he did not bear the level of endurance shown by the Messengers of Firm Resolve concerning the rejection and abuse from his people. Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, indicated that his people had angered him and that he had sensed their disbelief (Kufr). He then threatened them with a punishment from Allah that might befall them if they did not believe in him. The signs of the torment began to appear in their atmosphere, and the precursors of the punishment started to move towards them. Yunus then thought that he had fulfilled the burdens of the message (al-Risalah), as he had clarified the path for his people, introduced them to Allah's Straight Path (Sirat Allah al-Mustaqim), and warned them against the causes of Allah's displeasure and wrath. He believed that Allah the Exalted would not restrict him if he emigrated from the land of his people and that he was free to go wherever he wished. So, he headed towards the sea and boarded a heavily laden ship. It appears that when the ship's crew saw him and witnessed his dignity and splendor, they did not attempt to stop him from boarding their vessel. However, when the sea became rough, the ship's passengers were compelled to lighten its load of people. They held a lottery to cast into the sea whoever's lot fell upon them. Yunus was « among the losers » (Surah As-Saffat: 141), meaning among those upon whom the arrows fell. He was cast into the sea while afflicted by the distress, grief, and worry that caused him to leave his people. Allah then prepared a whale (i.e., a large fish) for him, and the whale swallowed him. Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, protected Yunus from any harm within the whale; no bone was broken, and no flesh was scratched. Instead, the whale's belly became a temporary prison for Yunus. The darkness of the whale's belly, within the darkness of the sea, enveloped him. Yunus cried out, calling upon his Lord, appealing to Him with the word of Monotheism (Tawhid) for which Allah created jinn and humans, for which He revealed the Books and sent the Messengers, and for which the market of Paradise and Hell is established. He glorified Allah, purifying Him from every imperfection, and apologized to Allah for fleeing his people, saying: « There is no deity (worthy of worship) except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I was among the wrongdoers. » (Surah Al-Anbiya: 87). Allah answered his call and saved him from the distress. The whale rushed to the seashore and cast Yunus out onto the bare land (al-'Ara), while he was sick (saqim) from the intensity of the terror, distress, anxiety, and grief that had afflicted him. Allah caused a gourd plant (Yaqtin) to grow over him. *Yaqtin* is a plant that has no stem, and its fruit is called *al-Qara'* (pumpkin) or *al-Dubba'* (squash), a type of gourd. Scholars have mentioned the wisdom behind the gourd plant growing over Yunus: the leaf of the gourd plant is extremely soft, abundant, shady, and flies do not approach it. Its fruit can be eaten from the beginning to the end, raw or cooked, with its peel and seeds. It contains many benefits, strengthening the brain and body, and so on. This is why it is narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) loved the gourd. Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from the hadith of Anas ibn Malik that a tailor invited the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) to a meal he had prepared. Anas said: « I went with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) and I saw him searching for the pieces of gourd from around the platter. » He added: « I have loved the gourd ever since that day. » Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, restored Yunus to full health and informed him that his people had believed when they saw Allah's punishment approaching them. Allah accepted their faith and removed the punishment of disgrace from them in the life of this world. Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, commanded him to return to them and to continue guiding them to Allah's Straight Path. Yunus returned to them; they were more than one hundred thousand people. Allah bestowed upon them an abundance of goodness and blessings, and they lived in safety under the Law of Allah (Shari'ah) with which Yunus had been sent. Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, mentioned aspects of the story of Yunus in various places in His Noble Book, and in each context, He presented the discourse appropriate for it. In the Surah named Yunus entirely after him, He mentioned the favor He granted to the nation of Yunus, a unique favor among the preceding nations. He excluded them from the rule that the faith of disbelievers is of no benefit when they see the punishment, according to His saying (approximate translation): « But when they saw Our might, they said, 'We believe in Allah alone and disbelieve in that which we used to associate with Him.' But their belief did not benefit them when they saw Our might. (This is) the way of Allah which has passed concerning His servants; and the disbelievers thereupon lost (everything). » (Surah Ghafir: 84-85). The nation of Yunus was excluded from this rule, for when they saw the onset of the punishment approaching, they believed and believed Yunus. Regarding this, Allah says (approximate translation): « Why was there not among the generations a single town that believed so that its faith benefited it (and averted its punishment) - except the people of Yunus? When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the worldly life and permitted them enjoyment for a time. » (Surah Yunus: 98). In Surah Al-Anbiya (The Prophets), He says (approximate translation): « And (mention) Dhun-Nun, when he went off in anger and thought that We would not restrict him. He called out within the darknesses, 'There is no deity (worthy of worship) except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I was among the wrongdoers.' So We responded to him and saved him from the distress. And thus, We save the believers. » (Surah Al-Anbiya: 87-88). His saying, « Dhun-Nun » (the Companion of the Fish, *An-Nun* being the fish), refers to Yunus, whom Allah named as such due to the whale's swallowing him, His mercy upon him, and his stay inside it for a period of time, and His deliverance from drowning until He cast him onto the shore. His saying, « when he went off in anger » (*idh dhahaba mughadhiban*), means that he left angered by his people, filled with wrath towards them for their disbelief and denial of him, and they were angry at him. His saying, « and thought that We would not restrict him » (*fa-zanna an lan naqdira 'alayh*), means that he assumed that Allah the Exalted would not constrain him (make life difficult for him) if he left his disbelieving people after conveying his Lord's message. This was from his own personal judgment (*Ijtihad*). The meaning of *naqdira* is to constrain or make difficult, as in His saying (approximate translation): « But he whose provision is restricted - let him spend from that which Allah has given him. » (Surah At-Talaq: 7) and His saying (approximate translation): « Indeed, your Lord extends provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts (it) for him. » (Surah Al-Qasas: 82) and « Your Lord extends provision for whom He wills and restricts (it). » (Surah Al-Isra: 30) – meaning, He widens or restricts for whom He wills. It should not occur to the mind of a Muslim that *naqdira* here means « to be able », for no ordinary believer, let alone a Prophet, would think that Allah is incapable of anything or unable to do it, as He is Omnipotent over all things. Until the next chapter, if Allah wills. Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. * ### Chapter Forty-One: Continuation of Yunus ibn Matta I mentioned at the end of the previous chapter the meaning of Allah's saying about Yunus (approximate translation): « And (mention) Dhun-Nun, when he went off in anger and thought that We would not restrict him. » (Surah Al-Anbiya: 87). As for His saying (approximate translation): « He called out within the darknesses, 'There is no deity (worthy of worship) except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I was among the wrongdoers.' » (Surah Al-Anbiya: 87), this means he cried out, seeking help from his Lord, in the darkness of the whale's belly, in the deep sea, appealing to Him with the word of Monotheism, glorifying Allah the Exalted from every imperfection, describing Him with all perfection, and seeking forgiveness from Allah for having left his people without permission from Allah, saying: « There is no deity (worthy of worship) except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I was among the wrongdoers. » (Surah Al-Anbiya: 87). His saying, « Indeed, I was among the wrongdoers, » does not imply that he committed a sin or an act of disobedience. It is established that even Noah, a Messenger of Allah and one of the Messengers of Firm Resolve, said: « My Lord, indeed my son is of my family; and indeed, Your promise is the truth, and You are the most just of judges. He said, 'O Noah, indeed he is not of your family; indeed, he is (the result of) unrighteous work. So ask Me not for that about which you have no knowledge. Indeed, I advise you lest you be among the ignorant.' He said, 'My Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have mercy upon me, I will be among the losers.' » (Surah Hud: 45-47). As for His saying (approximate translation): « So We responded to him and saved him from the distress. And thus, We save the believers. » (Surah Al-Anbiya: 88), this means: We answered Yunus when he called upon Us while in the whale's belly, and We delivered him from the distress, worry, sadness, and affliction that befell him. The whale cast him onto the seashore, and We completed Our Favor upon him. Likewise, We save every believer who falls into grief and distress and seeks refuge in Us. We deliver him from his sorrow and affliction: « Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth? Is there any deity with Allah? Little do you remember. » (Surah An-Naml: 62). Allah the Exalted says in Surah As-Saffat (The Ranks): « And indeed, Yunus was among the messengers. When he ran away to the laden ship. And he drew lots and was among the losers (or defeated). Then the whale swallowed him while he was blameworthy. And had he not been of those who exalt Allah, he would have remained inside its belly until the Day they are resurrected. But We cast him onto the bare shore while he was sick. And We caused to grow over him a plant of gourd. And We sent him to [a people of] a hundred thousand or more. And they believed, so We gave them enjoyment for a time. » (Surah As-Saffat: 139-148). His saying, « ran away » (*abaq*), means that he left without fear or secretly. Then « he drew lots » (*fasahama*), meaning he participated in the lottery with the ship's passengers to cast into the sea whoever's lot fell upon them in order to lighten the ship's load and save those who were not designated. His saying, « was among the losers » (*fa-kana min al-mudhhadhina*), means that he was among the defeated upon whom the lot fell to be cast into the sea. His saying, « Then the whale swallowed him while he was blameworthy » (*fa-ltaqamahu al-hutu wa huwa mulim*), means that the whale swallowed Yunus while he was blameworthy or reproaching himself for leaving his people without permission from his Lord. Blame (*al-lawm*) is reproach and censure. The fact that some Prophets do something for which they are blamed through personal judgment (*Ijtihad*) is harmless. This even happened to the most perfect of Allah's creation and the Master of the Messengers, Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), on the Day of Badr, when he consulted his companions about what to do with the prisoners. Abu Bakr advised keeping them and accepting ransom, while Umar advised killing them to weaken the strength of the polytheists. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) never chose between two matters except for the easier one, unless it was a sin. So, he inclined towards Abu Bakr's opinion and accepted ransom from the prisoners. Allah reproached him for accepting the ransom and said concerning it (approximate translation): « It is not for a prophet to have captives until he has thoroughly subdued (the enemy) in the land. You desire the goods of this world, while Allah desires the Hereafter. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. If not for a decree from Allah that preceded, you would have been touched, for what you took, by a great punishment. So consume what you took of war booty (as) lawful and good, and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. » (Surah Al-Anfal: 67-69). As for His saying (approximate translation): « And had he not been of those who exalt Allah, he would have remained inside its belly until the Day they are resurrected. » (Surah As-Saffat: 143-144), this means that had Yunus not been of those who frequently remember Allah, glorifying Him with praise in ease and hardship, We would have made the whale's belly his grave. But he knew Allah in times of ease, so Allah relieved his distress in hardship. This is why it is reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said to Ibn Abbas, as narrated by Ahmad and some compilers of the Sunan: « O young man, I will teach you some words: Guard Allah, and He will guard you. Guard Allah, and you will find Him in front of you. Know Allah in times of ease, and He will know you in times of hardship. » His saying (approximate translation): « But We cast him onto the bare shore while he was sick » (*fa-nabadhnahu bi-al-'ara-i wa huwa saqim*), means that We commanded the whale to cast him onto the seashore, on the open land. He was weakened and sick from the grief, distress, and the whale's belly. The word « or » (*aw*) in His saying (approximate translation): « And We sent him to [a people of] a hundred thousand or more » is not an expression of doubt about the number sent to, but rather for correction (*idrab*), meaning « rather ». He first established the number one hundred thousand, so this large number settled in the minds of the listeners, and then he mentioned that they were « or more », which is an increase in the emphasis on the magnitude of the number sent to. This is more eloquent and concise than saying: « He was sent to more than one hundred thousand. » This serves as consolation for the heart of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) because of the favor Allah bestowed upon Yunus. The amount beyond one hundred thousand is known only to Allah, as no specific determination of this increase was reported from the infallible Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). His saying (approximate translation): « And they believed, so We gave them enjoyment for a time » (*fa-amanu fa-matta'nahum ila hin*), means that they persisted in their faith and increased in belief through what Yunus prescribed for them. Allah opened the doors of blessings and goodness for them as long as they adhered to the religion Yunus brought to them. Allah says in Surah Nun (Al-Qalam): « So be patient for the decision of your Lord, and be not like the Companion of the Fish (Yunus) when he called out while he was distressed. If not for the favor from his Lord which reached him, he would have been cast onto the bare shore while he was condemned. But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous. » (Surah Al-Qalam: 48-50). In this noble context of mentioning Yunus, Allah begins by commanding His beloved Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) to be patient with the abuse of his people, no matter what they did, because he is the Master of the Messengers of Firm Resolve. Then He warns him against letting his patience run out as his brother Yunus's did after he was filled with distress and grief due to the harm from his people. Yunus is not among the Messengers of Firm Resolve; he is one of the Messengers who are not among the *Ulul-'Azm*. Allah said about one of them, their father Adam (approximate translation): « And We had already taken a covenant from Adam before, but he forgot; and We found not in him firm resolve. » (Surah Ta-Ha: 115). And the Master of the Messengers, Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), was told (approximate translation): « So be patient, as were those of firm resolve among the messengers; and do not seek to hasten (the punishment) for them. » (Surah Al-Ahqaf: 35). This does not prevent the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) from following the example of his brothers, the Prophets, in the guidance they brought, including Yunus. That is why when Allah mentioned a group of Prophets and Messengers in Surah Al-An'am (The Cattle), including Yunus, Allah said to His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) after mentioning them (approximate translation): « Those are the ones whom Allah has guided, so take their guidance as an example. » (Surah Al-An'am: 90). Until the next chapter, if Allah wills. Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. * ### Chapter Forty-Two: Continuation of Yunus I mentioned at the end of the previous chapter the meaning of Allah's saying about Yunus from Surah Nun (Al-Qalam): « So be patient for the decision of your Lord, and be not like the Companion of the Fish » (Surah Al-Qalam: 48). His saying (approximate translation): « when he called out while he was distressed » (Surah Al-Qalam: 48) is not included in the prohibition, for the call (invocation) of the distressed and his prayer to his Lord are beloved and sought. The meaning of « when he called out while he was distressed » is that he called upon his Lord while he was filled with distress and grief, when he said while in the whale's belly: « There is no deity (worthy of worship) except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I was among the wrongdoers. » (Surah Al-Anbiya: 87). As for His saying (approximate translation): « If not for the favor from his Lord which reached him, he would have been cast onto the bare shore while he was condemned » (Surah Al-Qalam: 49), this means: Had it not been for the mercy and care of Allah that reached him, he would have been cast onto the open ground while blamed (condemned). But since Allah's mercy reached him, the whale cast him onto the shore without being blamed. It is as if Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, favored Yunus and did not hold him accountable for his personal judgment (*Ijtihad*) in leaving his people in anger without permission from his Lord, just as He favored Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) by not holding him accountable for accepting the ransom of the prisoners on the Day of Badr, when He said (approximate translation): « If not for a decree from Allah that preceded, you would have been touched, for what you took, by a great punishment. » (Surah Al-Anfal: 68). The particle *Lawla* (If not for) is a particle of abstention for a reason. The answer was omitted here because its condition existed. Everyone who is not reached by Allah's mercy is condemned, but Yunus was not condemned because Allah's mercy reached him. His saying (approximate translation): « But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous » (Surah Al-Qalam: 50) is an additional favor from Allah the Exalted upon Yunus, meaning that Allah chose him (*ijtabahu*), i.e., elevated his rank among the chosen and the best, and placed him among the perfect in righteousness (*as-salihin*). Many authentic hadiths indicate the virtue of Yunus and prohibit preferring the Master of the Prophets and the Chief of the Messengers, Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), over Yunus ibn Matta. These are interpreted as being a matter of his humility (*Tawadu'*), as I mentioned in the story of Ibrahim, Lot, and Joseph, where the humility of a person of high rank does not diminish his status. The Qur'an explicitly states that Allah favored some Prophets over others, as in His saying (approximate translation): « Those messengers - We preferred some of them over others. Among them were those to whom Allah spoke, and He raised some of them in degrees (or ranks). » (Surah Al-Baqarah: 253). There is no doubt among the people of knowledge that the Messengers of Firm Resolve (Ulul-'Azm), namely Muhammad, then his spiritual father Ibrahim, are superior to the other Prophets and Messengers. The best of the *Ulul-'Azm* is Muhammad, the Beloved of the Most Merciful (peace and blessings be upon them all). However, scholars have ruled that if the situation is one of conflict between religions and a cause for inciting evil and harming Muslims, then abstaining from expressing preference (*Tafdhil*) is necessary, in accordance with His saying (approximate translation): « And do not insult those they invoke other than Allah, lest they insult Allah in enmity without knowledge. Thus, We have made pleasing to every community their own doings. Then to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them about what they used to do. » (Surah Al-An'am: 108). Idols and statues deserve to be insulted, but if insulting them provokes their worshippers against the Muslims, then insulting them is forbidden for that reason. Similarly, expressing preference (*Tafdhil*) out of pride, bias, or fanaticism (*Asabiyyah*) is forbidden. This is how the reports from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) prohibiting him from being preferred over Moses or Yunus ibn Matta (peace and blessings be upon them all) are interpreted. Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah that a Jew was displaying his goods. He was offered something for them that he disliked or rejected, and he said: « No, by Him Who chose Moses over humanity! » A man from the Ansar (Medinese) heard him and slapped him saying: « Do you say, 'By Him Who chose Moses over humanity,' while the Messenger of Allah is among us? » The Jew went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) and said: « O Abul-Qasim (the Prophet's nickname), so-and-so slapped my face! » The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: « Why did you slap his face? » He said: « He said, 'By Him Who chose Moses over humanity,' and you are among us, O Messenger of Allah. » The Messenger of Allah became angry until the anger was visible on his face, then he said: « Do not make distinction of preference between the Prophets of Allah. » He added: « For the Trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will be struck down, except whom Allah wills. » He said: « Then it will be blown again, and I will be the first to be resurrected, or among the first. Then, I will see Moses holding onto the Throne (of Allah). I do not know if he was resurrected before me or if he was exempted from the stunning (swoon) on the Day of the Mount (Tur). And I do not say that anyone is better than Yunus ibn Matta. » His saying in this hadith concerning Moses: « I will be the first to be resurrected, and I will see Moses holding onto the Throne. I do not know if he was resurrected before me or if he was exempted from the stunning on the Day of the Mount » does not indicate that Moses is better than Muhammad, as the rule established among scholars is that particular excellence (*al-maziyyah*) does not negate general superiority (*al-afdaliyyah*). That is, if a person is proven to have a particular excellence over another in one aspect, it does not mean that the possessor of this excellence is superior to the other. For example, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) saw in his dream that Bilal was walking in front of him in Paradise. Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated, with the wording of Al-Bukhari, from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to Bilal at the Fajr prayer: « O Bilal, tell me about the most hopeful deed you have done in Islam, for I heard the light sound of your sandals ahead of me in Paradise. » He replied: « The most hopeful deed I have done is that I never performed ablution (purification) at any time of night or day except that I prayed with those ablutions whatever Allah decreed for me to pray. » And in a narration by Muslim: « I heard tonight. » And in another narration, instead of « the light sound of your sandals » (*daffu na'layk*), it is « the rustle of your sandals » (*khashfu na'layk*), with *Daff* and *Khashf* both meaning a light movement. In the narration of At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Khuzaymah, and Ahmad, from the hadith of Buraydah, in this hadith of Bilal, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: « O Bilal, how did you precede me to Paradise? » It would not cross the mind of any Muslim that Bilal is superior to the Messenger of Allah because of this particular excellence. Perhaps someone might think he is better than Yunus ibn Matta upon hearing His saying (approximate translation): « and be not like the Companion of the Fish » (Surah Al-Qalam: 48), being ignorant that the purpose of this noble mention is to warn the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) – as I mentioned – to emulate the Messengers of Firm Resolve in the matter of patience, and not to emulate those who are not of the *Ulul-'Azm* in this regard. He also forgets that Allah commanded His Messenger Muhammad to emulate the Prophets and Messengers, including Yunus, in the path toward the Straight Path, as mentioned in Surah Al-An'am. For all these reasons, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) warned Muslims against any satanic thought in this matter. Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from the hadith of Ibn Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: « It does not befit a servant to say: 'I am better than Yunus ibn Matta,' » mentioning him by his father's name. And in a narration by Al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: « It does not befit a servant to say: 'I am better than Yunus ibn Matta.' » Likewise, Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: « It does not befit a servant to say: 'I am better than Yunus ibn Matta.' Peace be upon Yunus among the Messengers. » Until the next chapter, if Allah wills. Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.",

Others suggest it is derived from *As-Siyahah* (traveling), which is moving about the earth for propagation and worship. Ibn Manzur in *Lisan Al-Arab* reported that Ibn Sida said: “The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon our Prophet and upon them both), was named so for his truthfulness, or because he was a perpetual traveler in the land, not settling.” Still others say he was named the Messiah because he came out of his mother's womb anointed (mamsuh) with oil, just as the Dajjal is called the Messiah because he has a rubbed-out (mamsuh) eye (i.e., blind). The Messiah of Guidance, Jesus son of Mary, will kill the Messiah of Misguidance, the Dajjal, as informed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he descends at the end of time. As for the name 'Isa (Jesus), some say it is not derived, and is a Hebrew or Syriac name that the corruptors have changed and altered to 'Yasou' (Jesus). Others say it is derived from *Al-'Ays*, which is a whiteness tinged with redness, and the white camels whose whiteness is mixed with a reddish hue are called *'Is*. * ### The Habitation and Mission of Jesus Allah the Blessed and Most High indicated that He prepared for Jesus and his mother a high place (rabwah) with a resting place and a flowing spring ('ayn). The *rabwah* is a raised place, and being *dhat qarar* means it is level for its dwellers to settle upon, and *Al-Ma'in* is visible, flowing water. There is no authentic narration specifying the exact location of this elevated place. Some people say it is Jerusalem, others the Ghouta of Damascus, others Palestine, and yet others the Faiyum region of Egypt. The knowledge of this rests with Allah. The intent is that Allah the Blessed and Most High facilitated a safe habitation and a righteous dwelling for them. In this regard, Allah the Most High says: *“And We made the son of Mary and his mother a Sign, and We gave them refuge on a high ground (rabwah) having a place of rest and a flowing spring ('ayn).”* [Al-Mu'minun: 50]. Allah the Blessed and Most High indicated that Jesus learned writing and that Allah granted him Wisdom and understanding of the Torah. When he reached his full strength, Allah sent him to the Children of Israel and revealed to him the Gospel (Al-Injil), which contained guidance, light, and an admonition for the righteous, along with the glad tidings (bishara) of the Master of the Messengers (Muhammad). Allah commanded him to call the Children of Israel to judge by the Gospel. Allah the Blessed and Most High supported Jesus with stunning sensory miracles and manifest, overwhelming signs testifying that he was a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds. * ### The Five Miracles of Jesus Jesus came to the Children of Israel, informing them that he was the Messenger of Allah and His servant, that He had granted him the Gospel, that there is no deity but Allah, and no one truly worthy of worship other than Him. He informed them that he had come to them with signs from their Lord, consisting of five sensory signs: 1. Creating the shape of a bird from clay and breathing into it so it becomes a bird by Allah's permission: He would mold the shape of a bird from clay, then breathe into it, and it would become a bird and fly away by Allah's permission, as they watched with their own eyes. This miracle was to be a clear sign that he was a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds. 2. Curing the one born blind (Al-Akmah) by Allah's permission: The *Akmah* is one born with both eyes rubbed out (lacking pupils). Curing him to see is beyond the capacity of any physician, ancient or modern, and it is one of the most manifest physical miracles that no human can accomplish. 3. Curing and healing the leper (Al-Abras) by Allah's permission: Leprosy is a known disease, a whiteness that affects human skin, which skilled doctors have been unable to treat throughout history. 4. Resurrecting the dead by Allah's permission: These four signs are beyond the ability of any single human being, past or present. This followed the Divine Law that Allah sends every prophet with a miracle that surpasses the highest degree of knowledge in which his people excelled, to make the truth more apparent and for them to know it is from Allah. Thus, Moses was sent when his people excelled in magic, and Jesus was sent during a time when people were skilled in medicine and the knowledge of nature. *“And [make him] a messenger to the Children of Israel, [who will say]: 'Indeed, I have come to you with a sign from your Lord in that I design for you from clay [that which is] like the form of a bird, then I breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by permission of Allah. And I cure the blind [from birth] and the leper, and I give life to the dead by permission of Allah. And I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers. And [I have come] confirming that which was before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you. And I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and obey me. Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path.'”* [Al 'Imran: 48-51]. 5. Informing them of what they ate and what they stored in their homes: He would say to one of them: You ate such-and-such today, and you have stored such-and-such in your house for tomorrow, something they knew no one else could know. Jesus informed them that this was a sign from Allah, benefiting those whose hearts Allah opened to faith. Jesus believed in the preceding heavenly Books, confirmed the Torah, and his law made lawful for the Children of Israel some things that were forbidden to them in the law of Moses. He clarified for them the correct view on the issues they differed upon, showing them the truth and correctness. He then presented the essence of his call: to sincerely worship Allah alone and obey what Allah legislated through him, demanding of them the fear of Allah: *“So fear Allah and obey me. Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path.”* [Al 'Imran: 50-51]. * ### Jesus, the Last Prophet of Israel and the Announcer of Muhammad Allah the Blessed and Most High indicated that He made Jesus the last of the prophets sent specifically to the Children of Israel. Jesus came confirming the Torah and bearing the glad tidings of the Messenger who would come after him, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whose name is also Ahmad. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that he was the closest person to Jesus, son of Mary, as there was no prophet between them. He said: *“The prophets are children of 'Allat (brothers from the same father but different mothers); their mothers are diverse, but their religion is one, and there is no prophet between me and him.”* The meaning of *“children of 'Allat”* is that the root of the religion of all prophets is one (Tawhid\/Monotheism, Prophethood, Resurrection, etc.), while the specific laws and regulations (*shari'ah*) vary according to the time and place of each nation, as Allah said: *“For each We have appointed a divine law (shir'ah) and a clear way (minhaj).”* [Al-Ma'idah: 48]. The word Injil (Gospel) is a Greek word meaning Glad Tidings. Although the Gospel revealed to Jesus was a Book of legal rulings, it prominently featured the glad tidings (bishara) of the coming of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), fulfilling the covenant Allah took from all the prophets. Allah the Most High said: *“And [mention] when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, 'O Children of Israel, indeed I am the messenger of Allah to you, confirming what came before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad.' But when he came to them with clear evidences, they said, 'This is obvious magic.'”* [As-Saff: 6]. Ahmad or Muhammad is the meaning of *'Al-Munhamanna'* or *'Al-Farqalit'* (the Paraclete) mentioned in the books held by Christians, as it signifies *the one praised abundantly* (Al-Mahmud Al-Hamd Al-Kathir). The scholars of the People of the Book knew the descriptions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as well as they knew their own sons, due to the prophets' prophecies. * ### The Disciples and the Table from Heaven Jesus presented his bright message, backed by miracles, to the Children of Israel. Despite the signs, he faced hardship and conspiracy from a faction of the Children of Israel who deemed him a sorcerer and colluded with the pagan Romans against him. However, a group of the Children of Israel believed in Jesus and became his Disciples (Al-Hawariyyun), who were his closest companions and supporters. The word *Hawari* originally means minister, helper, or launderer (due to their white clothes or their purifying role). Allah inspired (awha) the Disciples to believe in Jesus and support him. The Disciples, though not prophets, were not infallible, as they asked Jesus: *“O Jesus, Son of Mary, is your Lord able to send down to us a table [spread with food] from the heaven?”* [Al-Ma'idah: 112]. Jesus warned them of the grave nature of this request but they explained that they wished to eat from it, for their hearts to be assured, their faith to increase, and to be witnesses of the miracle. Jesus then supplicated to Allah: *“O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table [spread with food] from the heaven to be for us a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You. And provide for us, and You are the best of providers.”* Allah replied: *“Indeed, I will send it down to you. But whoever disbelieves among you after that, then indeed, I will punish him with a punishment which I have not punished anyone among the worlds.”* [Al-Ma'idah: 114-115]. The whole Surah (Chapter) of the Qur'an is named after this event: Al-Ma'idah (The Table Spread with Food). The Jews and the Romans intended to kill Christ, the son of Mary, and were determined to slay him. Stories of the Prophets, The True Narrative 312. When they surrounded his dwelling and thought they had overcome him, Allah, blessed and exalted be He, saved him from their evil and their scheme. He cast his likeness upon one of his haters, whom they mistook for 'Issa (Jesus). They seized him, killed him, and crucified him. As for 'Issa, Allah raised him to Himself and foiled the plotting of the plotters, repelling the scheme of the disbelievers. Regarding this, Allah, Exalted is He, says: « And they planned, and Allah planned. And Allah is the best of planners. [Mention] when Allah said, \"O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you in that which you used to differ. And as for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with a severe punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. But as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, He will give them in full their rewards. And Allah does not like the wrongdoers. » [Surah Al 'Imrân: 54-57]. Thus, Allah decreed to grant victory to His Messengers and the believers, and to humiliate His disbelieving enemies. Allah, Exalted is He, has affirmed that 'Issa was neither killed nor crucified, but that a likeness was made for the Jews. Regarding this, He says: « And [We cursed them] for their disbelief and their saying against Mary a great slander, and [for] their saying, \"Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. \" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him for certain. Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise. » [Surah An-Nisâ’: 156-158]. And if you wonder, then it is indeed strange that the Christians should believe the Jews' claim that they killed and crucified the Christ, especially those who deviated from the truth and claimed that 'Issa is a god or the son of God. How can it cross the mind of anyone with the slightest trace of reason to believe that a god can be crucified or killed? It is mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark that those who intended to kill and crucify the Christ did not know him. In the twenty-sixth chapter of the Book of Matthew, in verse forty-seven of that chapter: « While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, who had come from the chief priests and the elders of the people. » And in verse forty-eight: « Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, \"The one I will kiss is the man; seize him. \" » And in the Gospel of Mark, in the fourteenth chapter, in verse forty-three thereof: « Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. » And in verse forty-four: « Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, \"The one I will kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away safely. \" » To be continued in the next chapter, if Allah wills, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Seventy-Sixth, Continued: Christ, Son of Mary 314 Stories of the Prophets, The True Narrative. I mentioned at the end of the previous chapter that those who intended to kill and crucify the Christ did not know him, and I cited the text from the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark regarding this. It is also mentioned in the Gospels accepted by the Christians that Allah instilled doubt even in the hearts of 'Issa's companions regarding the identity of the Christ, so they became hesitant whether this was Jesus who was taken to be killed and crucified or someone else. There was a great resemblance between the Christ and Judas Iscariot, who entered upon the Christ to hand him over to the Jews and Romans. Thus, they did not know whether the one who was taken was the Christ or Judas Iscariot. The four Gospels report the Christ's saying to His companions on the night His enemies determined to seize Him: « You will all fall away because of me this night » as mentioned in the twenty-sixth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, in verse thirty-one, and as mentioned in the fourteenth chapter of the Gospel of Mark, in verse twenty-seven. The Gospel of Barnabas explicitly states that the soldiers seized Judas Iscariot himself, thinking he was the Christ, because his likeness was cast upon him. George Sale, the Englishman, mentioned in his translation of the Qur'an in Surah Al 'Imrân, on page thirty-eight, that Judas Iscariot resembled the Christ in his features. He also mentioned that a sect from the oldest Christian sects, the Cerinthians and the Carpocratians, denied the crucifixion of the Christ and stated that the one crucified was Judas Iscariot, who resembled him perfectly. End of quote. And the Christians are in consensus that Judas Iscariot disappeared after the crucifixion incident and did not reappear, although Christians differed on the story of his end. In the Gospel of Matthew, in the twenty-seventh chapter, in verse four, it is mentioned about Judas Iscariot that he « went and hanged himself. » The Epistle of Acts of the Apostles contradicted the Gospel of Matthew regarding the end of Judas Iscariot. Chapter Seventy-Sixth, Continued: Christ, Son of Mary 315 In the first chapter, in verse eighteen of the Epistle of Acts of the Apostles, authored by Luke, the owner of the Gospel, it is mentioned about Judas: « Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. » This contradiction between the Gospel of Matthew and the Epistle of Acts of the Apostles—and the Christians sanctify these two books—I say: This contradiction is evidence of their ignorance of the fate of Judas Iscariot, a clear and irrefutable proof that the person crucified by the Jews and Romans was not the certain identity [of Jesus] according to them. Allah, blessed and exalted be He, confirmed this meaning with His saying: « And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him for certain. Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise. » [Surah An-Nisâ’: 157-158]. And they fell into doubt and confusion. The matter was ambiguous for the Jews, Christians, and Romans, and the hesitation: was the crucified one 'Issa or someone else? Some of them would say: it was indeed Jesus, and some would say: it was someone else. This was due to the resemblance of Judas Iscariot to 'Issa. Added to this, there was another person with him, Barabbas, as mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew, in verse seventeen of the twenty-seventh chapter, where Pilate, as they were gathered, said to them: « Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ? » And Allah, blessed and exalted be He, raised Christ, the son of Mary, to Himself and rescued him from the hateful and envious disbelievers. Regarding this, He says in Surah Al 'Imrân: « O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself... » [Surah Al 'Imrân: 55]. And He says in Surah An-Nisâ’: « Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise. » [Surah An-Nisâ’: 158]. The majority of the people of the Sunnah and the Community hold that Allah, Exalted is He, raised Christ to Himself with his body and soul. They interpret the term 'Tawaffi' (taking a life) in His saying: « O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself... » as casting sleep upon him until Allah raised him to the sky, similar to His saying: « Allah takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that do not die [He takes] during their sleep. » [Surah Az-Zumar: 42], and His saying: « And it is He who takes your souls by night and knows what you have committed by day. » [Surah Al-An'âm: 60], meaning, He puts you to sleep at night and knows what you have earned of deeds during the day. 316 Stories of the Prophets, The True Narrative. And He specified sleep for the night and earning for the day, because that is the original pattern suitable for human nature. Although a person might not sleep at night or earn during the day, this harms his nature and the stability of his soul. The general consensus of the people of the Sunnah and the Community is that 'Issa is alive in the sky and that he will descend at the end of time upon the appearance of the False Messiah (Al-Dajjâl), whom he will kill at Ludd in the land of Palestine. He will also kill the Jews who are with him, pour out the wine, break the cross, abolish the Jizya (poll tax), kill the swine, and accept nothing but Islam. During the time of his descent, Gog and Magog will emerge, and they will swarm down from every hill. 'Issa will supplicate to Allah and call upon Him to destroy Gog and Magog, and Allah will answer his prayer. Allah, blessed and exalted be He, alluded to the descent of 'Issa at the end of time as one of the signs of the Hour, where He says: « And indeed, he is [a sign for] knowledge of the Hour. So have no doubt about it. » [Surah Az-Zukhruf: 61], according to the interpretation of some scholars of exegesis and commentary. That is, the descent of the Christ is a sign of the Hour's nearness, or that the creation of 'Issa without a father is proof that Allah is capable of all things, and that it is evidence of Allah's power to resurrect the dead and to raise people on the Day of Resurrection. Also, some scholars held that the meaning of His saying: « And there is none of the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe in him before his death. » [Surah An-Nisâ’: 159] is that all disbelievers among the Jews and Christians, when death comes to them and they are cut off from the world, will know that 'Issa is the servant of Allah, His Messenger, His Word which He cast upon Mary, and a Spirit from Him. They will believe that he was neither killed nor crucified, and they will affirm that Allah raised him to Himself and protected him from the plot and scheme of the Jews, and that he is neither a god nor the son of God, as the Christians claim—may the curses of Allah, the Angels, and all mankind be upon them and the Jews. This faith at the sight of death will not benefit them. The majority of exegetes refer the pronoun in « his death » to 'Issa, and that upon his descent, the righteous and the wicked will believe in him and hasten to affirm his truth. This is the apparent meaning, because His saying: « And there is none of the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe in him before his death. » [Surah An-Nisâ’: 159] was revealed to assert the falsehood of the Jews' claim of killing and crucifying 'Issa, and the acceptance of this claim by the ignorant Christians who submitted to them. Thus, Allah, Exalted is He, informed that the matter was not so, but a likeness was cast upon another person for them, and they killed the likeness while they did not realize it, but rather Allah raised him up to Himself, and he is alive, and he will descend before the Day of Resurrection. Chapter Seventy-Sixth, Continued: Christ, Son of Mary. The descent of the Christ at the end of time is one of the beliefs of the people of the Sunnah and the Community, from which only a misguided and doomed person would deviate. Al-Bukhârî and Muslim narrated through several chains from Abû Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: « By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, the son of Mary will surely descend among you as a just judge, he will break the cross, kill the swine, abolish the Jizya, and wealth will flow so abundantly that no one will accept it, and a single prostration will be better for him than the whole world and what is in it. » Then Abû Hurayrah would say: « Read if you wish: « And there is none of the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them. » [Surah An-Nisâ’: 159]. Similarly, Muslim narrated from the hadith of Abû Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: « By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, the son of Mary will surely utter the Talbiyah (invocation) at the valley of Ar-Rawhâ’, performing Hajj or 'Umrah, or combining them. » That is, he will combine the two. Likewise, Al-Bukhârî and Muslim narrated from the hadith of Abû Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: « How will you be when the Christ, son of Mary, descends among you, and your Imam is from among you? » Muslim also narrated in his Sahih from the hadith of Abû Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: « The Hour will not be established until the Romans descend at Al-A'mâq or Dâbiq. An army from Medina will go forth against them, consisting of the best people on earth at that time. When they line up for battle, the Romans will say: \"Do not stand between us and those who took captives from us; we will fight them. \" The Muslims will say: \"No, by Allah, never will we leave our brothers to you. \" They will fight them, and one third will flee, whom Allah will never forgive; one third will be killed, and they are the best martyrs with Allah; and one third will conquer, and they will never be afflicted by temptation. They will conquer Constantinople, and while they are dividing the spoils, having hung their swords on the olive trees of Ash-Shâm, Iblis (Satan) will cry out among them: \"The Messiah has come out behind you in your families! \" They will rush out, but it will be false. When they arrive, and they are preparing for battle and arranging the rows, 'Issa, son of Mary, peace and blessings be upon him, will descend. The call to prayer will be made, and he will lead them in prayer. When the enemy of Allah (the Dajjâl) sees him, he will dissolve as salt dissolves in water. If he were to leave him, he would dissolve until he perished, but Allah will kill him with his hand, and he will show them his blood on his spear. » And his saying: « The Messiah has come out behind you » refers to the Dajjâl. And his saying: « he will lead them in prayer » means the intention of the Muslims to follow their Imam in prayer, or the aforementioned Imam: « and your Imam is from among you. » The first interpretation is clearer due to the narration in Al-Bukhârî and Muslim: « he will be from among you. » Muslim also narrated from the hadith of Jâbir that the Messenger of Allah said: « A group from my Ummah will continue to fight for the truth, triumphant, until the Day of Resurrection. » He said: « Then 'Issa, son of Mary, will descend, and their Amir (leader) will say: \"Come, lead us in prayer. \" He will say: \"No, indeed, some of you are rulers over others, as an honor from Allah to this Ummah. \" » End of quote. This is evidence that Allah will preserve this Ummah's religion from alteration and change until the end of time, until the Christ, son of Mary, descends and rules by the Law of Muhammad. To be continued in the next chapter, if Allah wills, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Seventy-Seventh, Continued: Christ, Son of Mary 319 Here is another set of authentic hadiths, established from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, regarding the descent of Christ, the son of Mary, upon the appearance of the False Messiah (Al-Dajjâl). Muslim narrated in his Sahih from the hadith of An-Nawwâs ibn Sam'ân Al-Kilâbî that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, mentioned the Dajjâl to us one morning and belittled him and then magnified him, until we thought he was in the palm grove. When we returned to him in the afternoon, he recognized this. He said: « What preoccupied you and what did you magnify? » We said: « O Messenger of Allah, you mentioned the Dajjâl this morning, and you belittled him and then magnified him, until we thought he was in the palm grove. » He said: « It is not the Dajjâl that I fear most for you. If he appears while I am among you, I will be his contender on your behalf. But if he appears after me, then every man must be his own contender, and Allah is my Vicegerent over every Muslim. He is a young man with very curly hair, his eye is floating, I liken him to 'Abd Al-'Uzzâ ibn Qatan. He will appear on a path between Ash-Shâm (Greater Syria) and Iraq, and he will cause corruption to the right and to the left. O servants of Allah, be firm. » We said: « O Messenger of Allah, how long will he stay on Earth? » He said: « Forty days: one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week, and the rest of his days like your days. » We said: « O Messenger of Allah, on that day that is like a year, will the prayers of one day suffice us? » He said: « No. Estimate its measure for it. » We said: « O Messenger of Allah, what is his speed on Earth? » He said: « Like rain driven by the wind. He will come to a people and call them, and they will believe in him and respond to him. He will then command the sky to rain, and the earth to bring forth, and their livestock will return to them in the evening with the highest humps, the fullest udders, and the widest flanks. Then he will come to a people and call them, and they will reject his word. He will turn away from them, and they will awaken in the morning with nothing left of their wealth, in famine. Then he will pass by a ruin and say to it: \"Bring forth your treasures, \" and its treasures will follow him like the swarms of bees. Then he will call a man in the prime of his youth, strike him with a sword, and cut him into two pieces, the distance of a target's throw. Then he will call him, and he will come forward with a radiant, laughing face. And while he is thus, Allah will send the Christ, the son of Mary. 320 Stories of the Prophets, The True Narrative. He will descend at the white minaret, east of Damascus, between two garments dyed with saffron (or *hird*), placing his palms on the wings of two Angels. When he lowers his head, drops will fall from it, and when he raises it, beads like pearls will roll down from it. It will not be lawful for any disbeliever who senses the scent of his breath to remain alive, and his breath will extend as far as his gaze reaches. He will pursue him until he overtakes him at the gate of Ludd and kills him. Then 'Issa, the son of Mary, will come to a people whom Allah has protected from him. He will wipe their faces and inform them of their ranks in Paradise. While he is thus, Allah will reveal to 'Issa: \"I have brought forth servants of Mine whom no one will be able to fight. So gather My servants to Mount Tur. \" And Allah will send Gog and Magog, and they will swarm down from every hill. The first of them will pass by Lake Tiberias and drink all its water. The last of them will pass by and say: \"There was once water here. \" Then they will walk until they reach the Mountain of Al-Khamr (the Mountain of the Temple in Jerusalem), and they will say: \"We have killed those on Earth; let us kill those in the Sky. \" They will shoot their arrows toward the sky, and Allah will return their arrows stained with blood. The Prophet of Allah, 'Issa, and his companions will be besieged to the extent that the head of an ox will be better for one of them than a hundred dinars are for one of you today. The Prophet of Allah, 'Issa, and his companions will supplicate to Allah. Allah will then send the *Naghf* (worms) upon their necks, and they will die, all of them, as a single soul dies. Then the Prophet of Allah, 'Issa, and his companions will descend to the Earth, and they will not find a space of a hand span on the Earth that is not filled with their stench and putrefaction. The Prophet of Allah, 'Issa, and his companions will supplicate to Allah. Allah will then send birds with necks like those of Bactrian camels, which will carry them and throw them where Allah wills. Then Allah will send rain that no house of clay or hair (tent) can keep out, and it will wash the Earth until it leaves it like a mirror. Then it will be said to the Earth: \"Bring forth your fruits and restore your blessings. \" On that day, a group of people will eat from a single pomegranate and seek shade under its peel. And blessings will be put into the milk, to the extent that the milk of a she-camel will suffice a large group of people, the milk of a cow will suffice an entire tribe, and the milk of a sheep will suffice a small clan. While they are thus, Allah will send a pleasant wind that will take them under their armpits and take the soul of every believer and every Muslim. Only the wickedest people will remain, who will publicly copulate like donkeys, and it is upon them that the Hour will be established. » And his saying in the Hadith: « belittled him and then magnified him » means he humbled him and magnified him, or he lowered his voice after speaking at length to rest, then returned and raised his voice to reach all the listeners. And his saying: « until we thought he was in the palm grove » means in extreme proximity to us, and that he was near to appearing. Chapter Seventy-Seventh, Continued: Christ, Son of Mary. And his saying: « When we returned to him in the afternoon » means when we returned to our gathering, as the Messenger of Allah's discussion of the Dajjâl was in the morning. And his saying: « He is a young man with very curly hair » (*Shaabun Qaṭaṭ*) means very kinky hair. And his saying: « He will appear on a path between Ash-Shâm and Iraq » (*Khallatun*) means on a path between them. And his saying: « and their livestock will return to them in the evening with the highest humps »: *Sâriḥatuhum* are their grazing animals that go out at the beginning of the day to the pasture and return in the evening; *Adh-Dhurâ* is the plural of *Dharwah*, which is the top and the hump; and the meaning is that they increase in height due to the speed of their growth. And his saying: « the fullest udders » (*Asbaġhu Ḍurū'an*) means the longest udders due to the abundance of milk. And his saying: « and the widest flanks » (*Amadduhu Khawâṣir*) means due to their fullness from satiety. And his saying: « like the swarms of bees » (*Ka-Ya'âsîb An-Naḥl*): *Al-Ya'âsîb* is the plural of *Ya'sûb*, which is the male bee and their prince. The meaning here is the group of bees in their following of their *Ya'sûb*. The intent is that the treasures of the Earth will follow him just as the group of bees follows their *Ya'sûb* without ever lagging behind. And his saying: « and cut him into two pieces, the distance of a target's throw » (*Jazlatayn Ramiyata Al-Gharad*) means two pieces, and he will make the distance between the two pieces the extent of an arrow's throw toward the target. And his saying: « between two garments dyed with saffron (or *hird*) » (*Mahrūdatayn*): *Al-Mahrûd* garment is one dyed with *Waras* (a saffron-like dye) and then with saffron. And his saying: « whom no one will be able to fight » (*Lâ Yadâni Li'aḥadin Biqitâlihim*) means no one has the power to fight them. And his saying: « Allah will then send the *Naghf* upon their necks » (*Al-Naghf Fī Riqâbihim*) means Allah will inflict upon them the *Naghf*, which is a worm that affects the noses of camels and sheep. And his saying: « and they will die » (*Farsâ*) means dead. And his saying: « until it leaves it like a mirror » (*Kâz-Zulfa*) means like a mirror. And his saying: « and seek shade under its peel » (*Qahfihâ*): *Al-Qahf* is the peel. And *Al-Fi'âm* is a large group of people. And his saying: « who will publicly copulate like donkeys » (*Yatahârajûna Fīhâ Tahâruj Al-Ḥumur*) means they will lose all shame, and men will consort with women, and they will copulate in the streets without shyness or concern. The hadiths describing the descent of 'Issa upon the appearance of the False Messiah are mutawâtir (mass-transmitted). Ibn Kathîr said regarding the hadiths concerning the interpretation of the saying of Allah: « And there is none of the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them. » [Surah An-Nisâ’: 159], that they mention the descent of 'Issa, the son of Mary, from the sky at the end of time, before the Day of Resurrection, and that he will call to the worship of Allah alone, without any partner. After citing a large number of these hadiths reported in Al-Bukhârî, Muslim, Musnad Al-Imâm Ahmad, Sunan At-Tirmidhî, Abû Dâwûd, and the rest of the authors of the Sunan, he said: « These hadiths are mutawâtir from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, narrated by Abû Hurayrah, Ibn Mas'ûd, 'Uthmân ibn Abî Al-'Âs, Abû Umâmah, An-Nawwâs ibn Sam'ân, 'Abd Allah ibn 'Amr ibn Al-'Âs, Mujamma' ibn Jâriyah, and Abû Surayhah Hudhayfah ibn Usayd. They indicate the description of his descent and his location, that it will be in Ash-Shâm, specifically in Damascus, at the Eastern Minaret, and that this will be at the time of the *Fajr* (Dawn) prayer. » End of quote. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, described 'Issa, the son of Mary, as being of medium height, reddish, and whoever saw him would think he had just emerged from a *dīmās* (bathhouse) after bathing. Al-Bukhârî and Muslim narrated from the hadith of Abû Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, described 'Issa after seeing him on the night of the *Isrâ’* and *Mi'râj* (Night Journey and Ascension), saying: « Of medium height, reddish, as if he had just emerged from a *dīmās* (meaning the bathhouse). » In a narration by Al-Bukhârî from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar describing 'Issa, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: « As for 'Issa, he is reddish, curly-haired, with a broad chest. » And in a narration by Muslim from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, he said: « And Allah showed me, in a dream, at the Ka'bah, a man who was brown, the best brown man you could see, his hair reaching between his shoulders, his hair neither straight nor curly, water dripping from his head, placing his hands on the shoulders of two men, and he was circumambulating the House. I asked: \"Who is this? \" They said: \"He is the Christ, the son of Mary. \" » And in a wording by Al-Bukhârî from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, he said: « While I was sleeping, I saw myself circumambulating the Ka'bah, and behold, a man, brown, with straight hair, swaying between two men, water dripping from his head - or being poured over his head. I asked: \"Who is this? \" They said: \"The son of Mary. \" » The meaning of his saying: « of medium height » (*Rab'ah*) is average height, between tall and short. And the meaning of his saying: « curly-haired » (*Ja'd*) is that his hair is not straight (*Sabt*). And it is said: *Rajul Ja'd* (a curly-haired man) meaning a generous man. And the meaning of his saying: « brown » (*Âdam*) is a light brown color, and the reddish color can also be used to describe it if it is not excessively white. And his saying: « his hair reaching between his shoulders » (*Li-mmatuhu Bayna Mankibayhi*): The *Lammah* is the hair that goes past the earlobe. And the meaning of his saying: « his hair neither straight nor curly » (*Rajil Ash-Sha'r*) is used when his hair is between straightness and curliness. This qualifies the absolute description of 'Issa's hair as either 'straight' or 'curly'. And the meaning of his saying: « water dripping from his head » (*Yanṭif Ra'suhu Mâ'an*) means it is dripping and flowing. To be continued in the next chapter, if Allah wills, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Seventy-Eighth, Continued: Christ, Son of Mary. 323 Allah, blessed and exalted be He, mentioned in the enumeration of the Jews' crimes that they said to Moses: « Show us Allah outright », that they took the Calf after the clear proofs had come to them, that they killed the Prophets without right, that they broke the covenant, that they disbelieved in the verses of Allah, and that they transgressed the Sabbath. And that they said: « Our hearts are uncircumcised. » Then Allah, Exalted is He, said: « And [We cursed them] for their disbelief and their saying against Mary a great slander, and [for] their saying, \"Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. \" » [Surah An-Nisâ’: 156-157]. And His saying, Exalted is He, here: « the Messenger of Allah » (*Rasûla Allâh*) with the accusative (nasb) on *Rasûl* (Messenger), it is possible that it is a continuation of the Jews' statement, and they said it mockingly, similar to the saying of the polytheists of Mecca about Muhammad: « O you upon whom the message has been sent down, indeed you are mad. » [Surah Al-Ḥijr: 6], and the saying of Pharaoh about Moses: « Indeed, your messenger who was sent to you is mad. » [Surah Ash-Shu'arâ’: 27]. It is also possible that His saying: « the Messenger of Allah » is not part of the Jews' statement, but Allah mentioned it with the accusative for exclusivity and praise, to point to the atrocity of their deed, the degree of their ignorance, and the wickedness of their claim, their malice, and their hatred for the Prophets and Messengers. There is no doubt that the Apostles stood up after the raising of the Christ to spread the call to the Oneness of Allah, that there is no god but Allah, and that 'Issa is the servant of Allah, His Messenger, His Word which He cast upon Mary, and a Spirit from Him. They were subjected to all kinds of torture at the hands of the Jews and Romans, and not a single one of them claimed that 'Issa was a god or the son of God, or that Allah was the third of three. The call to Monotheism that 'Issa brought continued in its purity for a time, not too long. Then, a great persecution fell upon his followers. They were scattered, tortured, killed, and crucified until the hallmarks of Christianity almost disappeared from the Earth due to those persecutions carried out by the Roman Emperors and their governors, as well as the Jews. The most severe suffering they endured was during the reign of the Emperor Nero (46 CE), then the Emperor Trajan (106 CE), then the Emperor Decius (251 CE), then the Emperor Diocletian (284 CE). As for Nero, he accused them of burning the city of Rome and devised various tortures for them. He would order his followers to clothe the followers of 'Issa in animal hides and then throw them to the dogs to tear them apart. Some of these Christians were also dressed in clothes smeared with tar, and then used as torches to light the way. The Patriarch of Alexandria described some of what he witnessed under Decius, saying: « Fear seized everyone. Some fled with their religion, and every Christian was removed from state service, no matter how intelligent he was. Every Christian who was reported was quickly brought and presented to the idol temple, and he was required to offer a sacrifice to the idol. The punishment for whoever refused to offer the sacrifice was to become the sacrifice himself, after they had tried hard to force him by intimidation. » Then the Patriarch said: « And among the weak in faith were those who denied their Christianity, and some followed suit, while others clung to escape or were thrown into the depths of prisons. » End of quote. As for Diocletian, he came to Egypt and brought calamity upon it, ordering the demolition of churches, the burning of books, issuing an order to arrest bishops and throw them into the depths of prisons, and compelling Christians to deny their religion, killing about three hundred thousand of them. The followers of the Christ were called \"Naṣârâ \" (Nazarenes), in relation to Naṣrânah, the village of the Christ in the land of Galilee in Palestine. This village is also called Nazareth (An-Nâṣirah) or An-Naṣûriyyah. I do not know exactly when *An-Naṣrâniyyah* became the proper noun for the religion of the People of the Gospel. This word, with this meaning, was found in the early second century CE, when Pliny (Pliny the Younger), who was a governor in Asia, wrote a letter to the Emperor Trajan (in 106 CE) explaining his method of torturing Christians. He said: « I dealt with those accused of being Nazarenes in the following way: I asked them if they were Christians, and if they admitted it, I asked them again a second and a third time, threatening them with death. If they persisted, I carried out the death sentence on them. » Pliny then added: « The accusation was directed at many in unsigned documents, and they denied that they were Nazarenes. » End of quote. Chapter Seventy-Eighth, Continued: Christ, Son of Mary 325 It can be understood from the Holy Qur'an that they themselves coined this name, as Allah, blessed and exalted be He, says: « Those who said, \"We are Christians. \" » [Surah Al-Mâ’idah: 82]. The term *An-Naṣrâniyyah* (Christianity\/Nazarene-ism) does not inherently imply praise or blame, as it is a reference to a homeland, and association with a homeland implies neither praise nor blame, for a single homeland includes both righteous and wicked people. As for Christianity (*Al-Masīḥiyyah*), it is only proper to apply it to those who truly follow the Law of the Christ. After the mission of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, by which Allah abrogated every law, it is not appropriate to apply the name Christianity to the Nazarenes, because in reality, they do not follow the Christ. If they had followed him, they would have hastened to believe in Muhammad. That is why the Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, did not name them Christians, but rather called them the People of the Gospel (*Ahl Al-Injīl*). The Jews were the most hostile of people to the religion of Christ, the son of Mary, and they exerted every effort to destroy it. With their satanic thinking, they decided that some of them should pretend to embrace it and its followers in order to distort this religion and distance people from it. Saul the Jew, who was one of those keen on torturing and afflicting the Christians, stood up to carry out this deception. Christian scholars agree that he approved of the killing of Christians, and he would raid the churches, enter the houses, and drag away men and women to deliver them to prison. He was described in the Epistle of Acts of the Apostles as being « full of all deceit and all malice, son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, who does not cease to pervert the straight ways of the Lord », as stated in the thirteenth chapter of this epistle, in verse ten. Saul claimed that he went to the Jewish chief priest and requested letters from him to the congregations in Damascus, so that if he found any persons of « the Way » (*Min Aṭ-Ṭarīq*), whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. This was in the thirty-eighth year of the Common Era, a short time after the Christ was raised. Saul said of himself: « You have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it. And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. » Then Saul claimed that while he was on his way to Damascus, he saw Jesus, believed in him, and was named Paul. Luke, the author of the Gospel named after him, recounts this story of Saul as Saul claimed it, in his epistle called Acts of the Apostles. In the ninth chapter of this epistle concerning Saul, he says: « He went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. » And while he was traveling, « it happened that as he was approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. And falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, \"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? \" And he said, \"Who are you, Lord? \" And he said, \"I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. \" » Then he says: « And he, trembling and astonished, said, \"Lord, what do you want me to do? \" » Then he says: « And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, \"He is the Son of God. \" » The idea of 'Issa's divinity or his sonship to God was not previously known to the Christians; they knew him only as the servant of Allah, His Messenger, His Word cast upon Mary, and a Spirit from Him. When Saul, who called himself Paul, came with this claim, the Apostles denied it and doubted this story that Saul had fabricated. They did not forget that he was their greatest enemy among the Jews. However, Barnabas advised the Apostles not to be hasty with Saul and presented him favorably to them. Yet, Barnabas himself did not remain loyal to Saul. Not long after, the bonds of affection between them were severed. Moreover, the general body of disciples became alienated from Saul, and only Luke remained his companion, considering himself the closest disciple of Paul. Luke was a physician and was not one of the Apostles. Saul (Paul) later called him « the beloved physician. » Paul began to preach a Christianity that the Apostles did not know. He had received no teaching of any kind from 'Issa or the Apostles. He then began to claim that Jesus was teaching him directly from Heaven without any intermediary. He said: « No one is allowed to accept any other teaching than mine, » and forbade his disciples from listening to or taking anything from the Apostles. To be continued in the next chapter, if Allah wills, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Seventy-Ninth, Continued: Christ, Son of Mary 327 I mentioned at the end of the previous chapter that Saul, who called himself Paul, intended to abolish all the teachings the Apostles had received from the Christ. He would say: « No one is allowed to accept any other teaching than mine, » and forbade his disciples from listening to or taking anything from the Apostles. Regarding this, he says in a book he sent to his disciple Timothy: « As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine, nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculations rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith. The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. Certain persons, by swerving from these, have wandered into vain discussion, desiring to be teachers of the law, although they do not understand either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions. » He also says: « If anyone teaches a different doctrine, he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing. » Thus, this Jew, Saul, who claimed to have converted and named himself Paul, began to assert that he was the teacher of Christianity, disparaging all the Apostles and describing them as lacking understanding. He began to spread doctrines derived from the beliefs of Hindus, Buddhists, Greek philosophers, and some Jewish teachings. He introduced for the first time the idea of the Trinity and the concept that the Christ is the Son of God, and that He descended to sacrifice Himself as an expiation for the sin of mankind, and that He ascended to sit at the right hand of His Father to judge and condemn mankind. Exalted is Allah far above what they say! He did not stray far in his call from the saying of his forefathers, the Jews, who said: « Uzair is the son of Allah. » He took the claim that 'Issa is the Son of God from the corrupt and misguided claims of his forefathers. He added to it what he took from the Buddhists concerning Buddha, and what he took from the Hindus concerning Krishna, and what he took from others. 328 Stories of the Prophets, The True Narrative. Krishna is called by his Hindu followers the Savior, the Redeemer, the Comforter, the Good Shepherd, the Mediator, the Son of God, and the Second Person of the Holy Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Buddha was also called by some of his followers by these same titles, which are exactly those Paul applied to the Christ. The followers of Krishna said that he was born of the Virgin Devaki, whom God chose as the mother of His son because of her purity and chastity. Some followers of Buddha said that he was born of the Virgin Mâyâ, whom God chose as the mother of His son because of her purity and chastity. This is the very phrase Saul (Paul) applied to the Christ's mother and her child. The followers of Krishna said that people learned of his birth from his star that appeared in the sky. Some followers of Buddha said the same about Buddha. And the teachings of Saul (Paul) said: « When the Christ was born, his star appeared in the East, and by the appearance of his star, people knew the place of his birth. » The followers of Krishna also claimed that his mother Devaki was betrothed to Nanda, and when she gave birth to Krishna, Nanda heard a call from the sky telling him: « Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee with them to Kakul, and cross the Yamunâ River, for the king seeks to destroy him. » In the teachings that Saul spread: « When Jesus was born, Joseph the carpenter, the betrothed of His mother, was absent. Joseph the carpenter, the betrothed of Mary, the mother of Jesus, was warned in a dream to take the child and his mother and flee with them to Egypt, for the king sought to destroy him. » Likewise, the name of the city where Krishna was born and performed miraculous signs was Matr. And Saul spread that the name of the city to which Jesus the Christ, his mother, and her betrothed Joseph the carpenter migrated was Al-Maṭariyyah in Egypt, and that he performed miraculous signs there after leaving the land of Judea. Note that Krishna existed around 950 BCE, and Buddha existed around the middle of the sixth century BCE. Paul's teachings and ideas spread in the West among the pagans and Greeks at the same time they were resisted in the East. Paul says about this in a letter to his disciple Timothy: « You know that all who are in Asia have turned away from me. » Nevertheless, Paul continued to travel in the provinces, establish churches, deliver speeches, and send letters that became the pillar of the distorted Christianity, until he was killed during the persecutions of Nero in 66 or 76 CE. However, some of the Apostles, including Barnabas, who initially thought well of Paul, resisted these teachings that Paul brought. Barnabas authored a Gospel, the introduction of which mentions the reason for its composition: he wrote it to refute those who claimed the divinity of the Christ or that he was the son of God. Barnabas says at the beginning of his Gospel: « O dear ones, the marvelous and great God has visited us in these days with His Prophet Jesus Christ with great mercy for teaching, and with signs that Satan has taken as a pretext to mislead many under the guise of piety, preaching a doctrine of severe disbelief, calling the Christ the Son of God, rejecting the circumcision that God has always commanded, permitting all unclean flesh. Paul (Saul the Jew), whom I speak of only with sorrow, is among those who have strayed. This is the reason for which I write this truth that I have seen. » End of quote. Christian historians agree that in past ages there were various Gospels adopted by ancient Christian sects, and that each sect adhered only to its own Gospel. The Church decided in the early third century CE to keep only four Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and forbade all others. Some historians have mentioned that these four Gospels were not mentioned until the end of the second century CE. The first to mention all four Gospels was Irenaeus of Alexandria in 209 CE, and he was followed by Clement of Alexandria in 216 CE, who showed that these four Gospels were obligatory to accept. It is worth noting that these Gospels are more like the books of the Prophet's biography (*Sīrah*) which narrate about the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and include authentic, good, weak, and fabricated reports. No Christian has claimed that they contain the Gospel revealed to 'Issa, although they sometimes quote passages that undoubtedly align with what is known of the Christ concerning the Oneness of God, and that 'Issa is the Messenger of God and a Prophet among the Prophets. In the Gospel of Matthew, in the tenth chapter, in verse forty, in Jesus' address to the Apostles, he says: « The one who receives you receives me, and the one who receives me receives him who sent me. » And in the nineteenth chapter of Matthew, in verse eighteen: « You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. » And in verses thirty-one and thirty-two of the twenty-second chapter of Matthew: « Have you not read what was said to you by God: 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? » And in verses thirty-seven, thirty-eight, and thirty-nine of the twenty-third chapter of Matthew, he says: « O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! See, your house is left to you desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' » And in the Gospel of Mark, in the tenth chapter, in verse nineteen: « You know the commandments: Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother. » And in the twelfth chapter thereof, in verse twenty-six: « And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? » And from verses twenty-eight to thirty-two thereof: « One of the scribes came up and heard them disputing, and recognizing that he had answered them well, asked him, \"Which commandment is the most important of all? \" Jesus answered, \"The most important is: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' The second is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these. \" And the scribe said to him, \"You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that he is one, and there is no other besides him. \" » And the Gospel of John confirms the Oneness of God and that 'Issa is the Messenger of God, as stated in verse three of the seventeenth chapter: « And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. There is no doubt that these are the commandments of the Prophets that neither Saul nor the falsifiers among the Jews and Christians could erase. They are in accordance with what Muhammad brought, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. Towards this and its like are the words of the Almighty: « And how do they make you judge while they have the Torah, in which is the ruling of Allah? » [Al-Ma'idah: 43], and His saying, Exalted is He: « And let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein. » [Al-Ma'idah: 47]. And in a similar vein, Allah the Almighty says in the Ten Commandments: « Say, «Come, I will recite what your Lord has forbidden to you. [He commands] that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children for fear of poverty; We provide for you and for them. And do not approach immoralities – what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by legal right. This has He instructed you that you may use reason.» And do not approach the property of an orphan except in the way that is best until he reaches maturity. And give full measure and weight in justice; We do not charge any soul except [with that within] its capacity. And when you speak, be just, even if he should be near of kin; and fulfill the covenant of Allah. This has He instructed you that you may remember. And [further, He commanded], « This is My straight path, so follow it, and do not follow [other] paths, for they will separate you from His path. » This has He instructed you that you may become righteous. » [Al-An'am: 151-153]. It is reported on the authority of Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: « Whoever wishes to look at the testament of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, which bears his seal, let him read these verses: « Say, «Come, I will recite what your Lord has forbidden to you... » until His saying: «... that you may become righteous. » . To the next chapter, God willing, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Eighty: Stories of the Prophets, The True Narrative (Continuation: Jesus) I mentioned in the previous chapter that there were many Gospels, and that each Christian denomination had its own special Gospel, until the Church, in the early third century CE, decided to retain only four Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Here is a brief overview showing that these Gospels differ in the date of their compilation, the language in which they were written, the country in which they were composed, and the identity of their translator, and they also contain a number of contradictions among themselves. The Gospel of Matthew is attributed to Matthew the Apostle, one of the twelve disciples of Christ. He is known as Matthew the Tax Collector (publican), as before his connection with Christ, he was a tax collector for the Romans. Tax collectors were known at that time as publicans (Ashareen). His work was in Capernaum in the land of Galilee, Palestine. Matthew mentions in his Gospel how he entered the religion of Christ, saying in the ninth chapter of his Gospel: « As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, «Follow me.» And he rose and followed Him. And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and His disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, «Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?» But when He heard it, He said, «Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.» Christians differed on the date of compilation of this Gospel. Some claim it was authored in 93 CE, others in 41 CE. Some say it was authored during the reign of Emperor Claudius, without specifying the year, knowing that Claudius ruled for fourteen years. Horn says it was authored in 37, 38, 41, 43, 48, 61, 62, 63, or 64 CE. Chapter Eighty: Continuation - Jesus Christians also disputed the language in which this Gospel was written and the country in which it was authored. Some say it was written in Hebrew, others in Syriac, and others say it was written in Jerusalem. Some say it was translated into Greek. They agreed that it was known only in Greek, and they differed on who translated it into Greek. It is known that Matthew did not remain long in Palestine after the ascension of Christ in 47 CE. He traveled to many countries preaching Christianity and settled in Abyssinia, where some say he died. Others say he was pierced with a spear in Abyssinia after spending about twenty-three years there, following a severe beating inflicted upon him by one of the king of Abyssinia's assistants. As for the Gospel of Mark, its author was also of Jewish origin, and his family resided in Jerusalem. He was a disciple of Peter, the chief of the Apostles, at the time of Christ's appearance, but he was not one of the twelve Apostles. He was also a student of his uncle Barnabas, who was also one of the Apostles. This Gospel was written in Greek at the request of the people of Rome, during the reign of Emperor Nero. Sa'id ibn al-Batriq, the Christian historian, mentions in his history that this Gospel was dictated by Peter, the chief of the Apostles, to Mark in the city of Rome, and attributed to Mark. This is a strange and singular matter, as how could the chief of the Apostles narrate this Gospel from his disciple and then attribute it to the disciple instead of Peter? It is mentioned that some narrators assert that Mark did not write his Gospel until after the death of his master, Peter the Apostle. It is stated in the book *Muruj al-Akhbar fi Tarajim al-Abrar* that Mark denied the divinity of Christ, and that he composed his Gospel at the request of the people of Rome and was denying the divinity of Christ. Mark traveled from country to country, preaching Christianity, until he entered Egypt in the middle of the first century CE. He stayed there and began to preach Christianity, and a large number of Egyptians converted. However, he preferred to settle in Egypt, traveling sometimes to Rome and sometimes to North Africa, until the pagans intercepted him, imprisoned him, tortured him, and then killed him in 62 CE. As for the Gospel of Luke, its author was neither one of the Apostles nor one of their immediate disciples. Rather, he was a student of Paul (Saul the Jew), to whom he was deeply devoted and became his closest friend. There is disagreement about him. Some say he was an Antiochene, born in Antioch, while others say he was a Roman who grew up in Italy. Some say he was a physician, others that he was a painter. Luke referred to the reason for authoring his Gospel, which begins with his saying: « Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us, just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us, it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.» Christian historians disputed the date of compilation of this Gospel. It is said to have been authored in 53, 63, or 48 CE, and other dates have been proposed. The authorship of the Gospel of John is a matter of intense, deep dispute among Christian scholars. Many claim he is John son of Zebedee the fisherman, one of the Apostles, while others claim he is another John unrelated to the first. Some Christian scholars in the late second century CE denied the attribution of this Gospel to John the Apostle, at the time when Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of John the Apostle, was living. Yet, no one reported that Irenaeus heard from his teacher the authenticity of that attribution. Christian scholars have said that the entirety of the Gospel of John is the work of a student from the School of Alexandria, as stated in the Encyclopædia Britannica, which was co-authored by five hundred Christian scholars, the following text: « As for the Gospel of John, it is undoubtedly a forged book whose author intended to set two of the Apostles against each other, namely Saints John and Matthew. This forging author claimed in the text of the book that he was the disciple whom the Christ loved. The Church accepted this phrase at face value and asserted that the author was John the Apostle, placing his name on the book explicitly, even though its author is certainly someone other than John. This book is no different from some books of the Torah which have no connection to those to whom they are attributed. We are moved to pity and sympathy for those who exert their utmost effort to link, even by the flimsiest connection, that philosophical man who authored this book in the second generation with the great Apostle John the fisherman, for their efforts are futile, their stumbling without guidance. End quote. » To the next chapter, God willing, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Eighty-One: Continuation - Jesus Son of Mary I mentioned in the previous chapter the Encyclopædia Britannica's denial that the Gospel of John was authored by John the Apostle, and its assertion that it was the work of a forging writer from the second generation. The date of writing this Gospel is disputed. Some believe it was written in 59 CE, 69 CE, or 89 CE, and other dates have been mentioned. Most Christian historians affirm that the Gospel of John alone asserts the divinity of Christ. This indicates that it was authored to establish this divinity, which supports the view of those who say its author was a student of the School of Alexandria, which was at the forefront of the assertion of Christ's divinity, affirming what they inherited from Paul (Saul the Jew). These four Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—are contradictory in their form and content. One example of their difference in general appearance is that the chapters (sections) of the Gospel of Matthew are 28 chapters, Mark 16 chapters, Luke 24 chapters, and John 21 chapters. The contradictions of these Gospels regarding the substance of a single issue are shown in the following: The Gospel of Matthew asserts that Jesus is a descendant of Solomon son of David, while the Gospel of Luke asserts that Jesus is a descendant of Nathan son of David. The Gospel of Matthew asserts that Salathiel is the son of Jeconiah, while the Gospel of Luke asserts that Salathiel is the son of Neri. The Gospel of Matthew asserts that there are twenty-six generations from David to Jesus, while the Gospel of Luke asserts that there are forty-one generations from David to Jesus. Furthermore, the Gospel of Matthew asserts that the woman who followed Jesus when He departed to the regions of Tyre and Sidon was a Canaanite as stated in chapter fifteen. The Gospel of Mark asserts that this woman was a Gentile, Syrian Phoenician by race, as stated in chapter seven. The astonishing thing is that the hand of the Jewish Talmudists is evident in the phrasing of these Gospels, as the Jewish Talmud asserts that people are divided into two groups: Jews and Gentiles, and that Jews are superior to Gentiles, just as a human is superior to a beast, and that all Gentiles are dogs and pigs. These malicious teachings, which any person with the slightest bit of reason would reject, are attributed by the Gospels held by Christians to Jesus, as if he believed them—may Allah clear him of what they said. The odor of this malicious Talmudic doctrine emanates from the story of the woman who followed Jesus when He departed to Tyre and Sidon. In the fifteenth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, paragraphs 21 to 28: « And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, «Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.» But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and begged Him, saying, «Send her away, for she is crying out after us.» He answered, «I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.» But she came and knelt before Him, saying, «Lord, help me.» And He answered, «It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.» She said, «Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.» Then Jesus answered her, «O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.» And her daughter was healed instantly. And Jesus went on from there and passed along the Sea of Galilee. And He went up on the mountain and sat there. And great crowds came to Him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they laid them at His feet, and He healed them, so that the crowd wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.» In this text, they claim that Jesus described non-Israelites as dogs. The same description is found in the seventh chapter of the Gospel of Mark. If you wonder, it is even more wonderful that any sane person who believes in the Prophets and Messengers would believe that Jesus described non-Israelites as dogs—may Allah sanctify Him and clear Him of what they said. Despite the Church retaining only these four Gospels in the early third century CE, the dispute between the proponents of these four Gospels and the proponents of the other Gospels did not cease until the Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity. He found the Christians in a state of extreme conflict. Some believed that Christ was a servant and messenger of Allah, others claimed that he was the Son of God with the attribute of eternity, and others claimed that God was a third of three. So, he decided to convene a conference in Nicaea. There was a man of Libyan origin in Egypt named Arius, who was a strong advocate calling for the Oneness of God and asserting that Jesus was a servant and messenger of Allah. Arius began to resist the Church of Alexandria, which was propagating the doctrine of the divinity of Christ among the people, so Arius fought this church. The English writer L. Butcher says in her book *The History of the Coptic Nation*, translated into Arabic by a Coptic man named Iskandar Tadros, whose printing and supervision were handled by Tadros Shanuda Al-Manqabadi, the owner of the newspaper *Misr*, and printed at the Al-Fajalah Press in Egypt in 1891 CE (pages 191-192): « After that, the well-known Arius the Heretic, a friend and supporter of Meletius, of Libyan origin, appeared in Alexandria. Peter ordained him as a deacon in the Church. » She says on page 201: « As for the events that necessitated the convening of the Council of Nicaea and what happened in this council, they are known to many, as a group of theologians have mentioned them and explained them in detail, so there is no need to list them now. By 319 CE, the discontent of the Alexandrians increased and their outcry against the heresy that Arius was striving to propagate and teach to others multiplied. » She says on page 202: « This led Patriarch Alexander to take the necessary precautions to repel it. Finally, the Patriarch wrote a pastoral letter to Arius and his followers, warning them to abandon the path of misguidance they were following and return to the straight path, but he tried in vain to persuade them. Some researchers must know that the point of contention was concerning the divinity of Christ. » Then she says: « The fault is not with Arius, but with other groups who preceded him in creating these innovations, which he adopted. However, the influence of those groups was not as strong as the influence of Arius, who caused many to deny the mystery of the Godhead, until this teaching spread and became general. » She continues on page 203: « The result of all this was that Patriarch Alexander formed a council in 320 CE, in which Arius was excommunicated from membership in the Church, which was the third judgment issued against him in his life. However, Arius did not submit to this judgment and did not care about it. Instead, he left Alexandria for Palestine, where he gathered friends whom he greatly influenced. He completely won them over, so much so that Eusebius, the Bishop of Nicomedia, who was a classmate of Arius, adopted his doctrine exactly as it was. From then on, he later sought to win over Emperor Constantine to this doctrine. The aforementioned Emperor was a friend of Eusebius and greatly favored him. » To the next chapter, God willing, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Eighty-Two: Continuation - Jesus Son of Mary I indicated at the end of the previous chapter what the English author Butcher mentioned in her book *The History of the Coptic Nation*: that Arius was a strong advocate that Jesus was a servant and messenger of Allah, neither a god nor the son of a god. She continues, explaining the reasons for convening the Council of Nicaea: « After Arius planted his doctrine in Eusebius, the Bishop of Nicomedia, he returned to Palestine, where Eusebius, the Bishop of Caesarea, and other bishops permitted him to hold religious assemblies in various dioceses to preach. » The author then refers on pages 204 and 205 to the spread of Arius's call, and that the Emperor sent a letter to both Patriarch Alexander and Arius in an attempt to stop the conflict. Seeing that he failed to stop this division, Constantine issued orders for all bishops to meet in Nicaea to examine this problem and render a decisive judgment with all clarity and scrutiny. Accordingly, this famous council convened in 325 CE, and the first version of the Nicene Creed was written there. She then says on page 207: « Some might think that the schism of Arius ended at this point. The truth is that it began to intensify. » Then she says on page 215: « As for Meletius and Arius, they did not submit to the ruling of the Council of Nicaea; therefore, new disturbances began to occur in the Egyptian Church. » The commentator on this book, Tadros Shanuda, mentions in a footnote to the decisions of the Council of Nicaea that the law established by the Nicene Council decided that Christians should pray standing instead of praying kneeling. The Church of Alexandria was determined to eliminate Arius and his doctrine. Patriarch Peter claimed that Christ cursed Arius and warned them against him. Peter said: « I saw Christ in a dream with His garment torn. I said to Him, 'O my Lord, who tore Your garment?' He said to me, 'Arius. Beware of letting him enter among you.'» Sa'id ibn al-Batriq, the famous Christian physician and historian, a native of Fustat, Egypt, born on the last Sunday of Dhul-Hijjah in 362 AH, appointed Patriarch of Alexandria on the 8th of Safar 423 AH, and died in Rajab 428 AH, presented in his history a description of the number and doctrines of those assembled at the Council of Nicaea. Ibn al-Batriq says: « King Constantine sent to all countries and gathered the Patriarchs and Bishops. Two thousand and forty-eight bishops assembled in the city of Nicaea. They differed in their opinions and religions. Some were saying that Christ and His mother were two gods besides Allah. Some were saying that Christ was with the Father like a flame of fire separated from another flame of fire, the first not diminishing by the separation of the second. Some were saying that Mary did not conceive Him for nine months, but that He passed through her womb as water passes through a gutter, because the Word entered through her ear and came out where the child comes out instantly. Some were saying that Christ was a human being created from the Divine like one of us in His essence, and that the Son began with Mary, and that He was chosen to be a savior for the human essence, accompanied by divine grace that resided in Him by love and will, and that is why He was called the Son of God. They said that God is one ancient essence and one person whom they call by three names, and they do not believe in the Word or the Holy Spirit. Some were saying that there were three eternal gods: one good, one evil, and one just between them. Finally, some were professing the divinity of Christ, which was the statement of Paul the Apostle (i.e., Saul the Jew).» Thus, Ibn al-Batriq provided a clear picture of the number and doctrines of those who gathered at the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE to determine the Christian religion. The last doctrine, the assertion of the divinity of Christ (which Paul\/Saul the Jew initiated), was supported by three hundred and eighteen bishops, and thirty-seven opposed them. The strange and singular thing is that Emperor Constantine only paid attention to the view of those who asserted the divinity of Christ. He held a special council for the proponents of this view, which Ibn al-Batriq describes: « The king set up a special and magnificent council for the three hundred and eighteen bishops. He sat in the middle of them, took his ring, his sword, and his scepter, handed them over to them, and said to them: 'I have given you authority over my kingdom today to do what is necessary for the establishment of the religion and the righteousness of the believers.' They blessed the king, gave him back his sword, and told him: 'Manifest the Christian religion and defend it.' They compiled forty books for him containing the laws and statutes, some of which were suitable for the king to know and act upon, and some of which were suitable for the bishops to act upon. End quote. » From this date, opposition to this doctrine was forbidden, its opponents were fought, and it was forbidden to follow any Gospel other than the four: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Allah, Exalted and Glorified, referred in His Noble Book to these Christian doctrines deviating from the religion of Christ. He says in Surah Maryam: « That is Jesus, the son of Mary—the word of truth about which they are in dispute. It is not appropriate for Allah to take a son; glory be to Him! When He decrees an affair, He only says to it, 'Be,' and it is. [And Jesus said], 'Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path.' But the factions differed among themselves [concerning Jesus]. So woe to those who disbelieved—from the scene of a tremendous Day. How clearly will they see and how plainly will they hear the Day they come to Us! But the wrongdoers today are in obvious error. » [Maryam: 34-38]. And He says, Exalted is He, in Surah Az-Zukhruf: « And when Jesus brought clear proofs, he said, 'I have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some of that over which you dispute, so fear Allah and obey me. Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path.' But the factions differed among themselves. So woe to those who wronged from the punishment of a painful Day. » [Az-Zukhruf: 63-65]. Even though the Jews and Christians affirm the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the One True God, in their books, the Jews worshipped Uzair (Ezra) as the son of Allah and took their rabbis as lords besides Allah, and the Christians worshipped the Christ and believed him to be a god and the son of a god, and took their monks as lords besides Allah. Concerning this, the Blessed and Exalted says in Surah At-Tawbah: « Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and do not forbid what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden and do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture—[fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled. The Jews say, « Uzair is the son of Allah »; and the Christians say, « The Messiah is the son of Allah.» That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded? They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides Allah, and [also] the Messiah, the son of Mary. And they were not commanded except to worship one God; there is no deity except Him. Exalted is He above whatever they associate with Him. They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it. It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, although the polytheists dislike it. » [At-Tawbah: 29-33]. To the next chapter, God willing, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Eighty-Three: Continuation - Jesus Son of Mary I mentioned at the end of the previous chapter what Allah, Exalted is He, stated in His Noble Book concerning the Jews and Christians taking their scholars and monks as lords besides Allah, and that they were commanded only to worship one God—there is no deity except Him, glory be to Him above what they associate with Him. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, informed that the Jews and Christians, when a righteous man among them died, would build a mosque over his grave and place images in it, indicating that Muslims should avoid such actions or anything that leads to the worship of other than Allah. Therefore, he warned against the Jews and Christians and prohibited turning graves into places of prayer. The agonies of death did not distract him from warning against this wicked deed. Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated on the authority of Aishah that Umm Habiba and Umm Salamah mentioned a church they had seen in Abyssinia with images. They mentioned it to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, who said: « Those people—when a righteous man among them died, they would build a place of worship over his grave and place those images in it. Those are the worst of creation in the sight of Allah on the Day of Resurrection. » In a narration by Al-Bukhari and Muslim, on the authority of Aishah and Ibn Abbas, when the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was afflicted with his final illness, he began to cast off a cloak he had over his face. When he felt distressed, he would uncover his face and say, « May the curse of Allah be upon the Jews and the Christians for taking the graves of their prophets as places of worship.» He was warning against what they did. In a narration by Al-Bukhari and Muslim, on the authority of Aishah, Umm Salamah mentioned to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, a church she had seen in the land of Abyssinia called Mariyah, and she mentioned the images she saw in it. The Messenger of Allah said: « Those are people who, when a righteous servant or righteous man died among them, built a place of worship over his grave and placed those images in it. Those are the worst of creation in the sight of Allah. » On the authority of Abu Hurairah, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: « May Allah fight the Jews, for they have taken the graves of their prophets as places of worship. » Al-Bukhari and Muslim also narrated on the authority of Aishah that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said during his final illness: « May Allah curse the Jews and the Christians for taking the graves of their prophets as places of worship. » She said: « Were it not for that, his grave would have been exposed, but I fear it would be taken as a place of worship. » Muslim also narrated in his *Sahih* on the authority of Jundub that he heard the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, five days before his death, saying: « I dissociate myself before Allah from having any intimate friend among you, for Allah has taken me as an intimate friend, just as He took Abraham as an intimate friend. If I were to take an intimate friend from my nation, I would have taken Abu Bakr as an intimate friend. Listen! Those before you used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous people as places of worship. Do not take graves as places of worship. I forbid you from that. » Allah, Exalted and Glorified, severely criticized those who believed that Allah had a child, denounced their statement, and discredited their belief. He established irrefutable proofs of the falsity of their doctrine and the corruption of their saying in many places in His Noble Book. He is Exalted: « He neither begets nor is begotten, and there is none co-equal or comparable to Him » [Al-Ikhlas: 3-4]. And that all who claim to be the son of Allah is a servant among His servants. And a servant cannot be the child of his Lord, Creator, Provider, and God. Claiming that Allah has a child is a terrible statement and an atrocious evil, so much so that the heavens are almost torn apart, the earth split open, and the mountains fall down in collapse. The Blessed and Exalted also pointed out the silliness of the minds of some Arab polytheists who believed that the angels were the daughters of Allah. When asked, « Who are the mothers of the angels? », they would say, « The noble ladies of the Jinn, » meaning the noble ones of the Jinn. Yet, when one of them was given the news of a girl, his face would darken, and he would suppress his grief, hiding from the people because of the bad news he had been given: « Should he keep her in humiliation or bury her in the dust? » How can they attribute a daughter to Allah when they do not rejoice when they beget one? This is one of their ugliest morals and worst beliefs. By this corrupt belief, they made a kinship between the Jinn and Allah. « And certainly, the jinn know that they will be brought [for punishment]. » Meaning, if they were relatives of Allah, He would not punish them. Exalted is Allah above what they describe, high above all! Concerning all this, Allah, Exalted is He, says in Surah Al-Baqarah: « And they say, « Allah has taken a son. » Exalted is He! Rather, to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are devoutly obedient to Him. » [Al-Baqarah: 116]. Chapter Eighty-Three: Continuation - Jesus Son of Mary And He says in Surah Yunus: « They say, « Allah has taken a son. » Exalted is He! He is the Free of need; to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Do you have any authority for this? Do you say about Allah that which you do not know? Say, « Indeed, those who invent a lie about Allah will not succeed. » [Yunus: 68-69]. And He says, Exalted is He, at the end of Surah Al-Isra: « And say, « Praise to Allah, who has not taken a son and has had no partner in [His] dominion and has no [need of a] protector out of weakness; and magnify Him with [great] magnification. » [Al-Isra: 111]. And He says at the beginning of Surah Al-Kahf: « [All] praise is [due] to Allah, who has sent down upon His Servant the Book and has not made therein any deviance. [He has made it] straight, to warn of a severe punishment from Him and to give good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a good reward in which they will remain forever and to warn those who say, « Allah has taken a son. » They have no knowledge of it, nor do their fathers. Grave is the word that comes out of their mouths; they speak not except a lie. » [Al-Kahf: 1-5]. And He says, Exalted is He, in Surah Maryam: « And they say, « The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son. » You have certainly brought forth a terrible thing. The heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains fall down in collapse because they attribute to the Most Merciful a son. And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful to take a son. There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant. He has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting. And all of them are coming to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone. » [Maryam: 88-95]. And He says in Surah Al-Anbiya: « And they say, « The Most Merciful has taken a son. » Exalted is He! Rather, they are honored servants. They do not precede Him in speech, and they act by His command. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they do not intercede except for one whom He approves, and they are from fear of Him apprehensive. And whoever of them should say, 'Indeed, I am a god besides Him'—that one We would recompense with Hell. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers. » [Al-Anbiya: 26-29]. And He says at the beginning of Surah Al-Furqan: « Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion upon His Servant that he may be to the worlds a warner—He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and who has not taken a son and has had no partner in [His] dominion and has created everything and determined it with [precise] determination. But they have taken besides Him gods who create nothing, while they themselves are created, and possess not for themselves any harm or benefit and possess not [the power of] death nor life nor resurrection. » [Al-Furqan: 1-3]. And He says, Exalted is He, in Surah Az-Zumar: « If Allah had intended to take a son, He could have selected from what He creates whatever He willed. Exalted is He! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible. » [Az-Zumar: 4]. Chapter Eighty-Three: Continuation - Jesus Son of Mary And He says, Exalted is He, in Surah Al-Jinn: « And [He revealed] that exalted is the majesty of our Lord; He has not taken a wife nor a son. » [Al-Jinn: 3]. And He says in Surah Al-Ikhlas: « Say, « He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is begotten, nor is there to Him any equivalent. » [Al-Ikhlas: 1-4]. And He says in Surah As-Saffat: « So inquire of them, 'Does your Lord have daughters while they have sons? Or did We create the angels as females while they were witnesses?' Unquestionably, it is out of their [invented] falsehood that they say, 'Allah has begotten.' And indeed, they are liars. Has He chosen daughters over sons? What is [the matter] with you? How do you make judgment? Then will you not be reminded? Or do you have a clear authority? Then produce your book, if you should be truthful. And they have made between Him and the jinn a kinship, but the jinn certainly know that they will be brought [for punishment]. Exalted is Allah above what they describe! » [As-Saffat: 149-159]. To the next chapter, God willing, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Eighty-Four: Continuation - Jesus Son of Mary I indicated in the previous chapter what Allah, Exalted and Glorified, related in His Noble Book. I cited a large number of these verses which prove the silliness of the minds of those who attribute a son to Allah, denouncing the corruption of their conception, and that they have fallen to the lowest depth in perception. Allah, Exalted and Glorified, also pointed out that whoever claims that Allah has a son has also associated a partner with Allah, as the child is a partner. Exalted is Allah above that, high above all! He is free from any partner, equal, peer, or wife. Concerning this, Allah, Exalted is He, says in Surah Al-An'am: « And they have attributed to the jinn partners with Allah, while He created them. And they have invented for Him sons and daughters without knowledge (without any proof or argument). Exalted is He and high above what they describe! [He is] the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a son when He does not have a companion? And He created all things, and He is, concerning all things, Knowing. That is Allah, your Lord; there is no deity except Him, the Creator of all things, so worship Him. And He is over all things a Trustee. Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted. » [Al-An'am: 100-103]. And He says, Exalted is He, in Surah An-Nahl: « And Allah has said, « Do not take for yourselves two deities. He is but one God, so fear only Me. » And to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and to Him is [due] worship constantly. Then will you fear other than Allah? And whatever favor you have—it is from Allah. Then when adversity touches you, to Him you cry for help. Then when He removes the adversity from you, at once a party of you associate others with their Lord, so that they will deny what We have granted them. Then enjoy [your temporary comforts]; but you are going to know. And they assign to Allah a portion of that which We have provided them, and they assign to [idols] whose nature they do not know, a portion of what We have provided them. By Allah, you will surely be questioned about what you used to invent. And they attribute to Allah daughters—Exalted is He!—and for themselves is that which they desire [sons]. And when one of them is informed of [the birth of] a female, his face becomes dark, and he suppresses grief. He hides himself from the people because of the bad tidings he has been given. Should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the dust? Unquestionably, evil is what they decide. For those who do not believe in the Hereafter is the worst description, and for Allah is the highest description. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. And if Allah were to impose blame upon the people for their wrongdoing, He would not have left upon the earth any creature, but He defers them for a specified term. And when their term has come, they will neither remain behind an hour nor precede [it]. And they attribute to Allah that which they dislike, and their tongues describe the lie that for them is the best. Assuredly, [for] them is the Fire, and they will be [therein] neglected. » [An-Nahl: 51-62]. And He says, Exalted is He, in Surah Az-Zukhruf: « And they have appointed for Him a portion of His servants [as equals]. Indeed, man is a clear ingrate. Or has He taken daughters from that which He creates and preferred you with sons? And when one of them is given good tidings of that which he attributes to the Most Merciful as an example [i.e., a daughter], his face remains dark, and he is suppressed by grief. So is one brought up in ornaments while he is in dispute, not manifest [in his argument]? And they made the angels, who are servants of the Most Merciful, females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded, and they will be questioned. » [Az-Zukhruf: 15-19]. And He says, Exalted is He, in Surah At-Tur: « Or has He daughters, while you have sons? » [At-Tur: 39]. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, informed on the authority of his Lord in the Hadith Qudsi that whoever claims that Allah has a son has insulted and reviled Allah. Woe to the one who insults and reviles Allah! And that were it not for the forbearance of Allah, He would have hastened the punishment upon them. Al-Bukhari narrated in his *Sahih* on the authority of Abu Hurairah that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: « Allah says: 'The son of Adam has reviled Me, and it was not proper for him to revile Me, and he has denied Me, and it was not proper for him to deny Me. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying that I have a son. As for his denying Me, it is his saying that I will not re-create him as I created him initially.'» Al-Bukhari also narrated in his *Sahih* on the authority of Abdullah ibn Abbas, the scholar of the Ummah and the interpreter of the Quran, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: « Allah said: 'The son of Adam has denied Me, and it was not proper for him to do so, and he has reviled Me, and it was not proper for him to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his claim that I am unable to re-create him as he was. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying that I have a son. Glory be to Me from taking a wife or a son!'» Muslim narrated in his *Sahih* on the authority of Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: « No one is more patient than Allah concerning the harm He hears. They associate partners with Him and attribute a son to Him, yet He [continues to] grant them health and provide for them. » In a version by Muslim on the authority of Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari (Abdullah ibn Qays), the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: « No one is more patient concerning the harm he hears than Allah the Almighty. They set up rivals to Him and attribute a son to Him, yet with all that, He provides for them, grants them health, and gives them. \"en\": \"## Chapter Eighty-Fourth: Continued Jesus, Son of Mary (p. 349) Despite these many clear and decisive (muhkamat) proofs in the Book of Allah the Almighty, revealed in Mecca and Medina, and in the sound, established reports of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) that Allah the Almighty is far removed from having a son or a partner, the Christians of Najran, when they came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) in the ninth year of the Hijra, tried to argue that Jesus is the Son of God based on certain words in the Book of Allah. They interpreted these words in a way not intended, due to deviation in their hearts, seeking discord and turning people away from the path of Allah. They claimed that the Quran contained a proof that Jesus is the Son of God in the verse about His saying: \"...and a Spirit from Him. \" \\[Surah An-Nisa (The Women): 171]. They interpreted the word \"from \" here as indicating a part, thus making Jesus a part and portion of God. They ignored the fact that the word \"from \" in this context is not intended to mean a part, but rather to indicate the beginning of the origin (the source), meaning that Jesus is one of the souls whose creation God began. They turned a blind eye to the many explicit verses stating that Jesus is a servant of Allah and a creature from His creation, and a servant cannot be a son, and that Allah: \"He neither begot nor was begotten. Nor is there to Him any equivalent. \" \\[Surah Al-Ikhlas (The Sincerity): 3-4]. The word \"from \" has many meanings, including the beginning of the origin, as in this case. Undoubtedly, the Arabs use the word \"from \" for many meanings, such as indicating the genus, as in His saying: \"So shun the abomination of idols... \" \\[Surah Al-Hajj (The Pilgrimage): 30], meaning: shun the abomination that is the idols. One of its meanings is \"part, \" as in your saying: \"I ate from this loaf, \" meaning: I ate a part of it. The Christians of Najran abandoned the manifest, decisive meaning and resorted to the unintended interpretation, exploiting the apparent similarity of the term, because of the deviation in their hearts. Allah the Blessed and Most High revealed concerning them, from the beginning of Surah Aal 'Imran up to the eighty-fourth verse, refuting their falsehood and dispelling their ambiguity, and explaining that because of the deviation in their hearts, they follow the ambiguous parts of the Quran and ignore the explicit, decisive ones, which prove that Allah has not taken a son. Indeed, Allah the Blessed and Most High made a part of the Quran decisive (muhkam), which is clear and manifest, and whose intended meaning is not hidden from the general and specific populace, and another part ambiguous (mutashabih), as a trial and test. The ambiguous word is that which can bear more than one meaning, such as the word \"from \" in His saying: \"...and a Spirit from Him. \" As for the people of faith, they refer the ambiguous to the decisive and interpret the word \"from \" here according to its intended meaning, which is the beginning of the origin. But those in whose hearts is deviation interpret it according to the unintended meaning. \"...but no one knows its interpretation except Allah. And those firmly grounded in knowledge say: 'We believe in it; all of it is from our Lord.' \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 7]. His speech neither contradicts nor clashes; exalted is Allah far above that. Allah the Blessed mentioned in this context of Surah Aal 'Imran clear proofs that \"There is no god but He, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 2], and that He revealed the Quran to Muhammad in truth, just as He revealed the Torah to Moses and the Gospel to Jesus as a guidance for mankind before this. And He sent down the Criterion (the Quran). Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah will have a severe punishment, and Allah is Exalted in Might, the Possessor of retribution. Indeed, from Allah nothing is concealed, whether in the earth or in the heaven. It is He who shapes you in the wombs however He wills. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 4-6]. To be continued in the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. --- ## Chapter Eighty-Fifth: Continued Jesus, Son of Mary (p. 351) After Allah the Blessed and Most High affirmed in the beginning of Surah Aal 'Imran that He is the Lord of everything and that \"There is no god but He, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. \" \\[Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow): 255], and confirmed the messages of Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon them), it necessitates that Jesus is a servant among the servants of Allah and a Messenger among His Messengers, neither a god nor the son of a god. As He says: \"Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. He has sent down to you the Book with the truth, confirming that which preceded it. And He sent down the Torah and the Gospel before, as guidance for the people. And He sent down the Criterion. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah will have a severe punishment, and Allah is Exalted in Might, the Possessor of retribution. Indeed, from Allah nothing is concealed, whether in the earth or in the heaven. It is He who shapes you in the wombs however He wills. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 1-6]. This serves to refute the ambiguity of the Christians of Najran and those like them who neglect the decisive (muhkam) verses that are manifest, clear, and absolute in their indication, which bear only one meaning, and instead cling to and argue with the ambiguous (mutashabih) terms, which, in principle, can have many meanings. Even if these meanings are not distinguishable from one another when the words are isolated, the context of the speech determines the intended meaning. It is a well-known matter in the context of speech that this context specifies the intended meaning. However, the one in whose heart is deviation and inclination away from the truth and toward falsehood follows the ambiguous parts and abandons the clear, manifest ones. In that regard, Allah says: \"It is He who has sent down to you the Book; in it are verses [that are] decisive (muhkamat) - they are the foundation of the Book \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 7]. Meaning: they are the fundamentals to which one reverts in case of disagreement or ambiguity, due to the absolute nature of their indication and their bearing only one meaning. \"And others are ambiguous (mutashabihat). \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 7]. Meaning: they can bear more than one meaning (as a trial and test, but the context of the speech determines the intended meaning). \"As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is ambiguous, seeking [to cause] discord and seeking [to obtain] its [false] interpretation. \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 7]. Meaning: those in whose hearts is an inclination away from the truth and rectitude towards false desires, those who deviate from the ways of guidance, and are intent on evil, corruption, and stubbornness, do not cling to the manifest, decisive verses, but rather deliberately aim for the ambiguous words, not seeking the truth, but seeking to cause discord among people about their religion through doubt, deception, and false interpretation according to the corrupt interpretations and deviant opinions they desire. They are not qualified to interpret the Book of Allah; its interpretation is known only to Allah and those whom He has guided among His servants firmly grounded in knowledge, who are established upon the truth, well-settled therein, and have not been shaken from guidance. That is why Allah says: \"...And those firmly grounded in knowledge say: 'We believe in it; all of it is from our Lord.' And no one will remember except those of understanding. \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 7]. Meaning: those who are firm in the truth and settled in knowledge and guidance hasten to believe in both the decisive and the ambiguous parts of the Book. They refer the ambiguous to the decisive and say that both the decisive and the ambiguous of the Quran are entirely from Allah, revealed in truth, and they neither contradict, clash, nor oppose one another. \"And if it had been from [any] other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction. \" \\[Surah An-Nisa (The Women): 82]. When the Christians of Najran did not rush to believe in the truth and confirm that Jesus is the servant and Messenger of Allah, neither a god nor the son of a god, Allah the Almighty commanded His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) to perform Mubâhalah (mutual imprecation) with them, after clarifying that \"Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 59]. Just as Allah created Adam without a father or a mother, but from dust, He created Jesus without a father, to show that Allah is Able to do all things, and nothing in the heavens or the earth is beyond Him. He then said: \"Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created him from dust; then He said to him, 'Be,' and he was. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters. Then whoever argues with you concerning him after what has come to you of knowledge - say, 'Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, then [let us] earnestly pray [to Allah] and invoke the curse of Allah upon the liars.' Indeed, this is the true narrative; and there is no deity except Allah. And indeed, Allah is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. But if they turn away, then indeed, Allah is Knowing of the corrupters. Say, 'O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah.' But if they turn away, then say, 'Bear witness that we are Muslims.' \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 59-64]. When Allah the Almighty commanded His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) to perform Mubâhalah with them, the Messenger of Allah hastened to them and recited the verse of Mubâhalah to them. They feared performing Mubâhalah with the Messenger of Allah, becoming certain that what he brought was the truth. Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih, from the Hadith of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: \"Al-Aqib and Al-Sayyid, the two men of Najran, came to the Messenger of Allah, desiring to perform the mutual imprecation with him. One of them said to his companion: 'Do not do it, for by Allah, if he is a Prophet and we perform the mutual imprecation with him, neither we nor our descendants after us will succeed.' They said: 'We will give you what you asked us for, and send with us a trustworthy man, and do not send with us anyone but a trustworthy man.' He said: \"I will certainly send with you a trustworthy man, truly trustworthy. \" The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) looked forward to it. He said: 'Stand up, O Abu Ubaydah ibn Al-Jarrah.' When he stood up, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"This is the trustworthy man of this Nation. \" \" In another narration by Al-Bukhari, from the Hadith of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him), he said: \"The people of Najran came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and said: 'Send us a trustworthy man.' He said: \"I will certainly send to you a trustworthy man, truly trustworthy. \" The people looked forward to it, and he sent Abu Ubaydah ibn Al-Jarrah. \" Muslim reported in his Sahih, from the Hadith of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: \"The people of Najran came to the Messenger of Allah and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, send to us a trustworthy man.' He said: \"I will certainly send to you a trustworthy man, truly trustworthy, truly trustworthy. \" He said: \"The people looked forward to it. He said: \"He sent Abu Ubaydah ibn Al-Jarrah. \" In a narration by Muslim, from the Hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), the people of Yemen came to the Messenger of Allah and said: 'Send with us a man who will teach us the Sunnah and Islam.' He took Abu Ubaydah's hand and said: \"This is the trustworthy man of this Nation. \" His saying to Jesus: \"And [I will] make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve, until the Day of Resurrection. \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 55] indicates that Allah the Blessed and Most High decreed that whoever believes in Jesus, confirms him, and acknowledges that he is the servant of Allah and His Messenger, His Word which He cast upon Mary, and a Spirit from Him, Allah will honor him and raise his status above every disbeliever in this worldly life. What then about what Allah has prepared for the believers in the Hereafter? This is similar to His saying: \"And never will Allah grant the disbelievers a way [to triumph] over the believers. \" \\[Surah An-Nisa (The Women): 141], and His saying: \"And truly it was incumbent upon Us to support the believers. \" \\[Surah Ar-Rum (The Romans): 47], and His saying: \"Indeed, We will support Our messengers and those who have believed during the life of this world and on the Day when the witnesses will stand. \" \\[Surah Ghafir (The Forgiver): 51], and His saying: \"O you who have believed, be supporters of Allah, as when Jesus, the son of Mary, said to the disciples, 'Who are my supporters for [the cause of] Allah?' The disciples said, 'We are supporters of Allah.' So a group of the Children of Israel believed and another group disbelieved. Then We supported those who believed against their enemy, and they became dominant. \" \\[Surah As-Saff (The Ranks): 14]. There is no doubt that after the sending of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), Allah abrogated the previous laws with His law. In a Hadith Qudsi (divine saying transmitted by the Prophet): \"By My Might and Majesty, if people came from every path and opened every door, I would not open for them unless they came through your path, O Muhammad, \" as mentioned by Ibn Al-Qayyim. There is no doubt that faith in Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) requires faith in Jesus and all the Prophets and Messengers (peace and blessings be upon them), according to His saying: \"Say, 'We believe in Allah and what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are in submission to Him.' \" \\[Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow): 136]. And His saying: \"Say, 'We have believed in Allah and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are in submission to Him.' And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers. \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 84-85]. To be continued in the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. --- ## Chapter Eighty-Sixth: Continued Jesus, Son of Mary (p. 355) I referred at the end of the previous chapter to the saying of Allah to Jesus: \"And [I will] make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve, until the Day of Resurrection. \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 55], and I cited similar verses in the Book of Allah the Almighty. This is not inconsistent with what may happen to the believers, such as being defeated in war or being afflicted by a wound, for Allah the Blessed and Most High may test \"...that Allah may purify those who believed and destroy the disbelievers. \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 141]. The believer is honored by Allah in both victory and defeat. That is why the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) did not rejoice when they gained an advantage over their enemy, nor did they despair when their enemy gained an advantage over them. In this regard, Ka'b ibn Zuhayr said in his poem *Bânat Su'âd*, describing the Companions of the Messenger of Allah: * \"They are not overly joyful when their spears reach a people, nor are they despairing when they are reached. \"* And Hassân (may Allah be pleased with him) said: * \"We are elevated when war reaches us with its claws. They do not boast when they gain an advantage over their enemy, and if they are afflicted, there is no weakness or panic. They are like lions in the battle and death is visible, when the frivolous people are humbled by its claws. \"* His saying: \"and death is visible \" means it is near and witnessed. They do not fear the causes of death. It is not known that any of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) was killed while turning his back in retreat. That is why Ka'b ibn Zuhayr said: * \"The thrusting does not occur except in their chests, and they have no hesitation concerning the watering-places of death. \"* His saying: \"and they have no hesitation concerning the watering-places of death \" means they do not flee from the sources of destruction and the battlefields, nor do they hold back from them. The support of Allah for His believing servants and their honor is achieved in every situation. Let us give an example from the story of the Companions of Ar-Rajî'. Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih, from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: \"The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) sent out a reconnaissance party and appointed 'Asim ibn Thâbit as their leader. They set out until they were between 'Ushfân and Mecca. They were mentioned to a tribe of Hudhayl called Banu Lihyan. They pursued them with nearly a hundred archers. They tracked their footprints until they came to a place where they had camped and found date-stones they had brought from Medina. They said: 'These are the dates of Yathrib.' They followed their tracks until they overtook them. When 'Asim and his companions were overtaken, they sought refuge on a fadfad (an elevated mound). The people came and surrounded them and said: 'We give you a covenant and a promise that if you descend to us, we will not kill any man among you.' 'Asim said: 'As for me, I will not descend under the protection of a disbeliever. O Allah, inform Your Prophet about us.' They shot them with arrows until they killed 'Asim and seven men. Khubayb, Zayd, and another man remained. They gave them the covenant and the promise. When they gave them the covenant and the promise, they descended to them. But when they gained control over them, they loosened the strings of their bows and tied them with them. The third man who was with them said: 'This is the first treachery.' He refused to accompany them. They dragged him and insisted that he accompany them, but he refused, so they killed him. They went with Khubayb and Zayd until they sold them in Mecca. Banu Al-Hârith ibn 'Amir ibn Nawfal bought Khubayb. Khubayb was the one who had killed Al-Hârith on the Day of Badr. He remained a captive with them. When they decided to kill him, he borrowed a razor from one of Al-Hârith's daughters to perform *istihdâd* (to clean himself and remove his pubic hair), and she lent it to him. She said: 'I was distracted from my young son, and he crawled to him until he reached him, and Khubayb placed him on his thigh. When I saw him, I was seized with a fright that Khubayb noticed, and the razor was in his hand. He said: 'Do you fear that I will kill him? I would not do that, if Allah wills.' She used to say: 'I never saw a captive better than Khubayb. I saw him eating a cluster of grapes, even though there was no fruit in Mecca at that time, and he was shackled in iron. It was nothing but sustenance Allah had provided for him.' They took him out of the sanctuary to kill him. He said: 'Let me pray two *rak'ât*.' Then he turned to them and said: 'Had I not feared that you would think that what I have is fear of death, I would have prolonged the prayer.' He was the first to establish the two *rak'ât* before being killed. Then he said: 'O Allah, count them by number.' Then he said: * \"I do not care when I am killed as a Muslim, in what side Allah causes my death. And if He wills, He will bless the limbs of a dismembered body. \"* 'Uqbah ibn Al-Hârith stepped forward and killed him. Quraysh sent for 'Asim to bring them something from his body to recognize him, for 'Asim had killed a great man of theirs on the Day of Badr. But Allah sent upon him what resembled a shade of Dabr (a cloud of wasps or male bees) to protect him from being mutilated. It protected him from their messengers, and they could not get anything from his body. Some people claimed that the meaning of Allah's saying: \"And [I will] make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 55] is that those who follow him are the Christians and those who disbelieve are the Jews. This is not a sound view. Indeed, whoever claims that Jesus is a god, or the son of a god, or that God is the third of a trinity, is not a follower of Jesus, but rather an enemy of his. The one who exaggerated concerning Jesus among the Christians is like the one who was negligent concerning him among the Jews. They are all enemies of Allah and enemies of the Messengers. That is why the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) warned the Muslims against exaggerating about him, just as the Christians exaggerated about Christ, the son of Mary. Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih, from the way of Ibn 'Abbâs (may Allah be pleased with them both), that he heard 'Umar ibn Al-Khattâb (may Allah be pleased with him) say on the *minbar*: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: « Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians exaggerated in praising Jesus, the son of Mary. For I am only a slave, so say: The slave of Allah and His Messenger. » \" The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) explained that no one who came after Jesus will enter Paradise unless he affirms that Jesus is the servant of Allah and His Messenger, His Word which He cast upon Mary, and a Spirit from Him. Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported in their Sahih, from the Hadith of 'Ubâdah ibn As-Sâmit (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: « Whoever testifies that there is no deity except Allah alone, without any partners, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, and that Jesus is the slave of Allah and His Messenger, and His Word which He cast upon Mary, and a Spirit from Him, and that Paradise is true, and the Fire is true, Allah will admit him into Paradise, whatever his deeds may have been. » Allah the Almighty has judged and decreed that whoever claims that Jesus is a god, or the son of a god, or that God is the third of three, is a disbeliever, a polytheist, to whom Allah forbids Paradise. As He says: \"They have certainly disbelieved who say that Allah is Christ, the son of Mary. Say, 'Then who could possess [power] against Allah at all if He had intended to destroy Christ, the son of Mary, or his mother or everyone on the earth?' And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. He creates what He wills, and Allah is over all things competent. \" \\[Surah Al-Ma'idah (The Table Spread): 17]. And He says: \"They have certainly disbelieved who say that Allah is Christ, the son of Mary. While [in fact] Christ had said, 'O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.' Indeed, he who associates others with Allah - Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers. They have certainly disbelieved who say, 'Allah is the third of three.' And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict those who disbelieve among them a painful punishment. \" \\[Surah Al-Ma'idah: 72-73]. To be continued in the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. --- ## Chapter Eighty-Seventh: Continued Jesus, Son of Mary (p. 359) I mentioned at the end of the previous chapter that Allah the Almighty judged as disbelievers those who claimed that Christ is the Son of God, or that He is God, or that God is the third of three, and I cited the explicit Quranic evidence for that. Allah the Blessed and Most High presented in His Noble Book a scene of truth where He questions Jesus the son of Mary, to denounce those who worshipped him and his mother besides Allah. He says: \"[Mention] the Day when Allah will assemble the messengers and say, 'What was the response given to you?' They will say, 'We have no knowledge; indeed, it is You who is the Knower of the unseen.' \" \\[Surah Al-Ma'idah: 109]. Then He says: \"And [mention] when Allah will say, 'O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?' He will say, 'Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within my soul, and I do not know what is within Yours. Indeed, it is You who is the Knower of the unseen. I said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness. If You should punish them - indeed, they are Your servants; but if You forgive them - indeed, it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.' \" \\[Surah Al-Ma'idah: 116-118]. His saying here: \"but if You forgive them - indeed, it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. \" \\[Surah Al-Ma'idah: 118] should not be understood to mean that one who dies in a state of polytheism may be forgiven. The speech focuses on the whole group to whom Jesus was sent, among whom were those who believed in him as the servant and Messenger of Allah, those who disbelieved in him during his lifetime among them, and those who disbelieved after his ascension, claiming he was a god or the son of a god. The context's purpose is to show that Jesus only told them what Allah commanded him: to worship Allah alone, without any partners. He testifies in favor of those who responded to him during his life, and against those who disobeyed him during his life as well. When Allah took him up to Him, his knowledge of their subsequent conditions was removed. Allah alone was the Observer over them. Jesus had no knowledge of their affairs regarding who followed the guidance or who deviated from the straight path. The matter of all rests with Allah: He punishes whom He wills among the disobedient out of His Justice, and rewards and forgives whom He wills out of His Grace, for all are His servants, and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. Muslim reported in his Sahih, from the Hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn Al-'Âs (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) recited the saying of Allah regarding Abraham: \"My Lord, indeed they have led astray many among the people. So whoever follows me is of me, and whoever disobeys me - indeed, You are Forgiving and Merciful. \" \\[Surah Ibrahim (Abraham): 36], and the saying of Jesus: \"If You should punish them - indeed, they are Your servants; but if You forgive them - indeed, it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. \" \\[Surah Al-Ma'idah: 118]. He then raised his hands and said: \"O Allah, my Nation! My Nation! \" and wept. Allah said: \"O Gabriel, go to Muhammad - and your Lord knows best - and ask him: What makes you weep? \" Gabriel (peace be upon him) came to him and asked him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) informed him of what he had said - and Allah knows best. Then Allah said: \"O Gabriel, go to Muhammad and tell him: We will satisfy you concerning your Nation and will not harm you. \" There is no doubt that until the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), there remained Christians who knew that Jesus is the servant of Allah and His Messenger, due to the continuation of the call of Arius and his followers. That is why, when Ja'far ibn Abî Tâlib recited to the Negus, the King of Abyssinia, a part of Surah Maryam (Mary) which included the story of the Christ's birth and his speaking in the cradle that he was the servant of Allah, that He had given him the Scripture and made him a prophet, the Negus wept until his beard was soaked. He affirmed that what Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) brought regarding the Oneness of Allah and what Jesus brought came from one and the same light source (*mishkâh wâhidah*). Ibn Ishâq said in the Prophetic Biography (*Sîrah Nabawiyyah*): Muhammad ibn Muslim Az-Zuhrî narrated to me, from Abu Bakr ibn 'Abd Ar-Rahmân ibn Al-Hârith ibn Hishâm Al-Makhzûmî, from Umm Salamah bint Abî Umayyah ibn Al-Mughîrah, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), who said: \"When we arrived in the land of Abyssinia, we had the best neighbor, the Negus. We were safe in our religion, and we worshipped Allah the Almighty, neither being harmed nor hearing anything we disliked. When Quraysh learned of this, they consulted among themselves to send two strong men to the Negus concerning us, and to present the Negus with gifts that were considered rare from Mecca. Leather was one of the most astonishing things that came from it. So they collected a great deal of leather, and they did not leave any of his generals (*batâriqah*) without giving him a gift. Then they sent 'Abdullah ibn Abî Rabî'ah and 'Amr ibn Al-'Âs with that. They instructed them with their orders, saying: 'Give the gift to every general before you speak to the Negus about them. Then present his gifts to the Negus and ask him to hand them over to you before he speaks to them.' She said: They set out until they came to the Negus, and we were in the best of dwellings, with the best of neighbors. They did not leave any of his generals without giving him his gift before speaking to the Negus. They said to each general: 'Some foolish youths from our people have sought refuge in the King's country. They have abandoned the religion of their people and have not entered your religion. They have brought a newly invented religion which neither we nor you know. The nobles of their people have sent us to the King concerning them, to return them to them, for their people are more watchful over them and more knowledgeable of what they criticize in them. Advise him, therefore, to hand them over to us and not to speak to them.' She said: They replied: 'Yes.' Then they presented their gifts to the Negus, and he accepted them from them. Then they spoke to him and said: 'O King, some foolish youths from our people have sought refuge in your country. They have abandoned the religion of their people and have not entered your religion. They have brought a newly invented religion which neither we nor you know. The nobles of their people, their fathers, uncles, and clans, have sent us to you concerning them, to return them to them, for their people are more watchful over them and more knowledgeable of what they criticize in them and have reprimanded them for it.' She said: Nothing was more hateful to 'Abdullah ibn Abî Rabî'ah and 'Amr ibn Al-'Âs than for the Negus to hear them speak. She said: Then the most eminent of his generals around him said: 'They speak the truth, O King. Their people are more watchful over them and more knowledgeable of what they criticize in them. Hand them over to them, so they may return them to their country and people.' She said: The Negus became angry and said: 'No, by God, I will not hand them over to them, nor will they harm them. A people who sought refuge with me, came to my country, and chose me over others! If they are as these two say about them, I will hand them over to them and return them to their people. But if they are otherwise, I will protect them from these two and be a good neighbor to them as long as they reside with me.' She said: Then he sent for the Companions of the Messenger of Allah and invited them. When they came, the Negus had summoned his bishops, who had spread their Gospels around him. They gathered, and some said to others: 'What will you say to the man when you come to him?' They said: 'By God, we will say what we know and what our Prophet has commanded us, whatever happens.' He said to them: 'What is this religion for which you have abandoned your people, and which you have not entered into my religion nor the religion of any of these communities?' She said: The one who spoke to him was Ja'far ibn Abî Tâlib. He said: 'O King, we were an ignorant people. We worshipped idols, ate the dead carcass, committed immoralities, cut off the ties of kinship, treated our neighbors badly, and the strong among us consumed the weak. We were upon that until Allah sent to us a Messenger from ourselves, whose lineage, truthfulness, trustworthiness, and chastity we know. He called us to Allah, that we should unite Him and worship Him, and remove what we and our fathers used to worship of stones and idols. He commanded us to be truthful in speech, to render trusts, to maintain the ties of kinship, to treat our neighbors well, and to refrain from unlawful acts and bloodshed. He forbade us from immoralities, false speech, consuming the property of the orphan, and slandering chaste women. He commanded us to worship Allah alone, associating nothing with Him. He commanded us to pray, to pay *Zakât*, and to fast.' She said: He enumerated the matters of Islam. 'We believed him, had faith in him, and followed him in what he brought from Allah. We worshipped Allah alone, associating nothing with Him. We forbade what He forbade us and permitted what He permitted us. Then our people attacked us, tortured us, and tempted us away from our religion to return us to the worship of idols instead of the worship of Allah the Almighty, and to permit vile things. When they overpowered us, wronged us, made life difficult for us, and came between us and our religion, we left for your country. We chose you over others, desired your protection, and hoped that we would not be wronged in your presence, O King.' She said: Then the Negus said to him: 'Do you have with you anything that he brought from Allah?' Ja'far said to him: 'Yes.' The Negus said: 'Then recite it to me.' He recited to him the beginning of a Surah of [Mary]. She said: By God, the Negus wept until his beard was soaked, and his bishops wept until their Gospels were soaked, when they heard what he recited to them. Then the Negus said: 'Indeed, this and what Jesus brought come from one and the same light source (*mishkâh wâhidah*). Go! By God, I will not hand them over to you, nor will they harm them...' To be continued in the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. --- ## Chapter Eighty-Eighth: Continued Jesus, Son of Mary (p. 363) I mentioned in the previous chapter that until the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), there remained Christians who knew the true religion, and that Jesus is the servant of Allah and His Messenger, His Word which He cast upon Mary, and a Spirit from Him. I recounted the story of the Negus, the King of Abyssinia, with the emigrant Companions of the Messenger of Allah, and how the Negus wept until his beard was soaked, and the priests and monks with him wept until their Gospels were soaked, upon hearing Ja'far ibn Abî Tâlib (may Allah be pleased with him) recite the beginning of Surah Maryam. Allah the Blessed and Most High alluded in His Noble Book to the weeping of some priests and monks when they heard the Quran, and He mentioned that those who recognize the truth are the closest in affection to the believers. In this regard, Allah says in Surah Al-Ma'idah (The Table Spread): \"You will surely find the most intense of people in animosity toward the believers to be the Jews and those who associate others with Allah; and you will surely find the nearest of them in affection to the believers to be those who say, 'We are Christians.' That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant. And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth. They say, 'Our Lord, we have believed, so register us among the witnesses. And why should we not believe in Allah and what has come to us of the truth, while we aspire that our Lord will admit us [to Paradise] with the righteous people?' So Allah rewarded them for what they said with Gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide forever. And that is the reward of the doers of good. \" \\[Surah Al-Ma'idah: 82-85]. He says in Surah Al-Isra' (The Night Journey): \"Indeed, those who were given knowledge before it - when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in prostration and say, 'Exalted is our Lord! Indeed, the promise of our Lord has been fulfilled.' And they fall upon their faces weeping, and it [the Qur'an] increases them in humble submission. \" \\[Surah Al-Isra': 107-109]. He says in Surah Al-Qasas (The Stories): \"Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it - they believe in it. And when it is recited to them, they say, 'We have believed in it; indeed, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed, we were, of submission, before it.' Those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured and [because] they avert evil with good, and they spend from what We have provided them. And when they hear ill speech, they turn away from it and say, 'For us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. Peace be upon you; we seek not the ignorant.' \" \\[Surah Al-Qasas: 52-55]. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) informed that whoever from the People of the Scripture believed in his Prophet, and then believed in Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), Allah will grant him his reward. Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported in their Sahih, from the Hadith of Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"There are three [types of] people for whom there are two rewards: A man from the People of the Scripture who believed in his Prophet and then believed in Muhammad, and a slave who fulfills the rights of Allah and the rights of his masters, and a man who had a female slave, educated her well, taught her well, then freed her and married her; he will have two rewards. \" His saying: \"That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant. \" \\[Surah Al-Ma'idah: 82] is not a praise for every priest or monk, nor is it an endorsement of these two titles. Rather, the praise is for the one who was a priest or a monk, and then recognized that the religion of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is the true religion, the religion of Islam, and that \"whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him. \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 85]. So he hastened to enter Islam and hold fast to its laws. That is why no one among them is described as a priest or a monk after entering Islam, just as a Jew or Christian who enters Islam is no longer described as a Jew or a Christian. Al-Qissîs (priest) is the head of the Christians in knowledge and religion. Its linguistic origin is \"to follow and seek a thing. \" Ru'bah ibn Al-'Ajjâj, describing chaste women who do not seek to spread gossip, said: * \"They wake up unconcerned with the seeking of harm (qass al-adhâ). \"* It is said: *taqassast aswâtahum bi-l-layl* (I listened attentively to their voices at night). Al-Rahbân is the plural of *Râhib* (monk), who among the Christians devotes himself to worship in hermitages and does not mix with people, derived from *Rahbâniyyah* (monasticism), which is worship in hermitages with the avoidance of women. The Christians innovated monasticism and imposed strictness upon themselves in it, according to His saying: \"...and monasticism, which they innovated; We did not prescribe it for them, except [that they sought] the approval of Allah ; but they did not observe it with due observance. \" \\[Surah Al-Hadid (The Iron): 27]. His saying: \"except [that they sought] the approval of Allah \" is a discontinuous exception, meaning: We did not prescribe it for them, but they innovated it by themselves, striving to seek the pleasure of Allah. They became like one who exhausts himself in traveling and stops; he has neither crossed the land nor preserved his mount. That is why the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) forbade extremism and exaggeration in religion, and commanded gentleness and ease. When news reached him that some of his Companions had been affected by the sermon of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) and had resolved not to eat meat, nor approach women, nor wear perfume, they gathered in the house of one of the Companions, and he forbade them from that with the strongest prohibition. Similarly, the story of the three groups of men who came to the wives of the Messenger of Allah asking about the worship of the Messenger of Allah. When they were informed, they seemed to regard it as little, and said: \"Where are we compared to the Messenger of Allah? Allah has forgiven him his past and future sins. \" One of them said: \"As for me, I will pray all night and never sleep. \" The other said: \"I will fast continuously and never break my fast. \" And the other said: \"I will abstain from women and never marry. \" The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) came to them and said: « Are you the ones who said such and such? By Allah, I am the most fearful of Allah among you and the most pious, but I fast and I break my fast, I pray and I sleep, and I marry women. Whoever turns away from my *Sunnah* (way) is not of me. » Allah the Blessed and Most High often condemned the Jews and Christians, explaining that their hearts are filled with mutual hatred, and that each faction accuses the other of having no basis. In this regard, Allah says: \"And they say, 'None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew or a Christian.' That is [merely] their aspirations. Say, 'Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.' \" \\[Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow): 111]. Meaning: The Jews said: None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew, and the Christians said: None will enter Paradise except one who is a Christian, and they have no proof other than these false aspirations. He says: \"And the Jews say, 'The Christians are not on anything,' and the Christians say, 'The Jews are not on anything,' while they recite the Scripture. Thus spoke those who did not know, like their saying. But Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ. \" \\[Surah Al-Baqarah: 113]. He says: \"And never will the Jews or the Christians approve of you until you follow their religion. Say, 'Indeed, the guidance of Allah is the [only] guidance.' If you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you would have against Allah no protector or helper. \" \\[Surah Al-Baqarah: 120]. And He says: \"And they say, 'Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided.' Say, 'Rather, [we follow] the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth, and he was not of the polytheists.' \" \\[Surah Al-Baqarah: 135]. And He says: \"Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob, when he said to his sons, 'What will you worship after me?' They said, 'We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac - one God. And we are in submission to Him.' Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants were Jews or Christians? Say, 'Are you more knowing or is Allah?' And who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do. \" \\[Surah Al-Baqarah: 140]. And He says: \"O People of the Scripture, why do you argue about Abraham while the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him? Then will you not reason? Here you are - those who argued about that for which you had [some] knowledge. But why do you argue about that for which you have no knowledge? And Allah knows, while you know not. Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a monotheist [inclining toward truth] and a Muslim [submitting to Allah]. And he was not of the polytheists. Indeed, the most deserving of all people to Abraham are those who followed him and this Prophet, and those who have believed. And Allah is the protector of the believers. \" \\[Surah Aal 'Imran: 65-68]. When the saying of Allah was revealed concerning the polytheists of Mecca: \"Indeed, you and whatever you worship other than Allah are the firewood of Hell. You will be incoming to it. Had these [false deities] been gods, they would not have entered it, but all are to abide therein eternally. For them therein is [only] sighing, and they will not hear therein. \" \\[Surah Al-Anbiya (The Prophets): 98-100], they said: \"Then we are satisfied that our gods will be with Jesus the son of Mary in the Fire, because Jesus is worshipped besides Allah. \" They were ignorant that whoever is worshipped besides Allah, but did not call people to worship him and is not pleased to be worshipped besides Allah, that will not harm him. So Allah revealed His saying: \"Indeed, those for whom the best [reward] has preceded from Us - they will be removed therefrom. \" \\[Surah Al-Anbiya: 101]. And He said: \"And when the son of Mary was presented as an example, immediately your people laughed at it. And they said, 'Are our gods better, or is he?' They did not present the comparison to you except to argue. But [in fact], they are a people given to dispute. He was not but a servant upon whom We conferred favor and made an example for the Children of Israel. And if We willed, We could have made [instead of you] angels in the land succeeding [one another]. And indeed, Jesus will be [a sign] for [knowledge of] the Hour, so do not be in doubt of it and follow Me. This is a straight path. And let not Satan avert you. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy. And when Jesus brought clear proofs, he said, 'I have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some of that over which you differ, so fear Allah and obey me. Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path.' But the factions differed among themselves, so woe to those who wronged from the punishment of a painful Day. \" \\[Surah Az-Zukhruf (The Ornaments of Gold): 57-65]. \"Peace be upon Jesus among the messengers! And [all] praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds! \" \\[Surah As-Saffat (Those Who Set the Ranks): 181-182]. }",

  "texte_original":"## Chapter Thirty-Eight: Ayyub (Job) In this chapter, we speak about the Prophet and Messenger of Allah, Ayyub (Job), the role model for the patient, whose patience in affliction is proverbial. Most scholars agree that he was from the progeny of Ibrahim (Abraham), based on Allah's statement (Al-An'am 6:83-84): \"That was Our argument, which We gave to Abraham against his people. We raise in degrees whom We will. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing. And We gave to him Isaac and Jacob. All [of them] We guided. And [before that] We guided Noah, and among his descendants, David and Solomon and Ayyub and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the doers of good.\" This is predicated on the pronoun in \"among his descendants\" referring back to Ibrahim, as the discourse is about him. Some scholars disagree, making the pronoun refer back to Noah, as he is the closest one mentioned, although Allah restricted the Prophethood after Ibrahim to his progeny (Al-Ankabut 29:27): \"And We placed in his descendants Prophethood and the Scripture.\" The story of Ayyub in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) includes several points: his affliction; the harm (Ad-Dhurr) that touched him in his person and family, causing him to feel 'Nusbun wa Adhâb' (fatigue, pain, and hardship) ; he was afflicted and made an oath to do something whose fulfillment would be painful and difficult for him; and he was tried with vast wealth and abundant property. Neither Allah nor His Messenger has definitively specified the exact nature of the physical affliction that struck Ayyub. However, the Glorious Quran indicates he suffered from a type of severe fever, as Allah made his cure to be washing and drinking cold water. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recommended washing with cold water for certain types of fever, as reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim: \"Fever is from the exhalation of Hell, so extinguish it with water\" (Reported by Ibn Umar and Aisha). However, not every illness or fever is treated by cooling with water; it is a specific type, as cold water can be lethal for some fevers. It is apparent that the illness that struck Ayyub was extreme in its severity and pain. This is not strange, as the people most severely tested are the Prophets, then the next best, then the next best (Ad-Dârimi, An-Nasa'i, At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Mâjah). Al-Bukhari and Muslim report a Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: \"I entered upon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) while he was suffering from a severe fever... The Messenger of Allah said: 'Yes, I am afflicted with a fever like that of two men among you.'\" And the Prophet added: \"No Muslim is afflicted by harm from illness or anything else, except that Allah will drop his sins as a tree drops its leaves.\" As for the stories mentioning that Ayyub's illness lasted so long that his companions shunned him, he was driven out of his town and cast onto a garbage heap outside it, people abandoned him, and only his wife remained devoted; that worms crawled over his body, and his flesh wasted away until only bone and sinew remained; and that this lasted for three, seven, thirteen, or eighteen years—none of these fabricated stories are established by an authentic report from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The consensus among scholars is that Allah protects His Prophets from repulsive diseases. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) indicated that Allah had given Ayyub vast wealth. Al-Bukhari reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said: \"While Ayyub was bathing naked, a swarm of golden grasshoppers fell upon him. He began scooping them into his garment. His Lord called out to him: 'O Ayyub, did I not enrich you from what you see?' He said: 'Yes, O Lord, but I have no independence from Your blessing (Barakah)!'\" Allah the Exalted narrated his story in two places in His Noble Book: 1. In Surah Al-Anbiya (21:83-84): \"And [mention] Job, when he called to his Lord, 'Indeed, adversity has touched me, and You are the most Merciful of the merciful.' So We responded to him and removed what was upon him of adversity. And We gave him [back] his family and the like thereof with them, as mercy from Us and a reminder for the worshippers.\" Allah followed this by stating that patience is a quality of the Messengers (21:85): \"And [mention] Ishmael and Idrees and Dhul-Kifl; all were of the patient.\" 2. In Surah Sad (38:41-44): \"And remember Our servant Job, when he called to his Lord, 'Indeed, Satan has afflicted me with distress and suffering (Nusbun wa Adhâb).' [So he was told], 'Strike [the ground] with your foot; this is a cool [water] bath and drink.' And We gave him [back] his family and the like thereof with them, as mercy from Us and a reminder for those of understanding. And take in your hand a bundle of sprouts, and strike therewith and do not break your oath. Indeed, We found him patient, an excellent servant. Indeed, he was ever returning [to Allah].\" In this noble context, Ayyub attributes the harm to Satan, out of respectful etiquette (Adab) towards Allah in attributing evil to Satan, who is the cause of every affliction that strikes the son of Adam in this world (being the one who caused Adam to be expelled from Paradise). As for the command: \"And take in your hand a bundle of sprouts...\" (Ad-Dhighth), which is a handful of mixed wet and dry grass, it refers to his having sworn in a state of anger to strike a loved one a specific number of times. Allah commanded him to fulfill his oath by striking the person with this bundle as a reward for his patience and excellence, because hitting with a whip or similar would have caused pain to both the striker and the struck. Allah thus relieved his distress. \"And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out and will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has already set for everything a [decreed] extent.\" (At-Talaq 65:2-3). To the next chapter, if Allah wills. Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.",

  "texte_original":"Ibn Sa'd reported that the Mother of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"When I gave birth to him, a light issued forth from my private parts and illuminated the palaces of Syria. \" Ahmad reported a similar account from Al-Irbad ibn Sariyah. It is narrated that foreshadowing events of the Prophetic Mission occurred at the time of birth: fourteen balconies of the iwan of Chosroes fell, the fire worshipped by the Magians was extinguished, and the churches around Lake Sawa collapsed after the lake dried up. These facts are reported by Al-Bayhaqi, but Muhammad Al-Ghazali does not endorse them. Among the Banu Sa'd: It was the custom of the Arabs residing in the settled areas to seek wet nurses for their children to keep them away from the diseases of the cities, so that their bodies would be strengthened, their nerves toughened, and they would master the Arabic language in their cradle. Abdul-Muttalib thus sought wet nurses for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and had him suckled by a woman from the Banu Sa'd ibn Bakr – she was Halima bint Abi Dhu'ayb – and her husband, Al-Harith ibn 'Abdul-'Uzza, nicknamed Abu Kabsha, from the same tribe. The foster-siblings of our Master Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) were: 'Abdullah ibn Al-Harith, Anisa bint Al-Harith, and Hudhafa or Judhama bint Al-Harith (who is Ash-Shayma – a nickname that predominated over her name). She used to nurse the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as well as Abu Sufyan ibn Al-Harith ibn 'Abdul-Muttalib, the cousin of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). His uncle Hamza ibn 'Abdul-Muttalib was also nursed among the Banu Sa'd ibn Bakr. His mother (Hamza's mother) breastfed the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one day while he was with his mother Halima. Thus, Hamza was the foster-brother of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in two ways: through Thuwayba and through the Sa'diyya woman. Halima witnessed wonders from the blessing of our Master Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Let us allow her to narrate it in detail: Ibn Ishaq said that Halima used to relate that she left her country with her husband and her suckling infant son, in the company of a group of women from the Banu Sa'd ibn Bakr, seeking infants to nurse. She said: \"That was in a year of drought ('shahba'), which had left us nothing. \" She said: \"I set out on my gray donkey, with an old she-camel of ours which, by Allah, did not yield a single drop (of milk). We did not sleep all night because of our child with us, due to his crying from hunger, for I had no milk in my breast to satisfy him, nor did our she-camel have anything to feed him. But we were hoping for rain and relief. \" She said: \"I set out on that donkey of mine, and it slowed down the riders until it became difficult for them due to its weakness and leanness, until we arrived in Mecca seeking infants to nurse. There was no woman among us to whom the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not offered, who did not refuse him when told he was an orphan. This was because we were hoping for the generosity of the child's father. We would say, 'An orphan? What can his mother and grandfather do?' So we disliked him for that. No woman who came with me remained without taking an infant, except for me. \" When we decided to depart, I said to my companion: \"By Allah, I dislike returning among my companions without having taken an infant. By Allah, I will go to that orphan and take him! \" He said: \"There is no harm in you doing so. Perhaps Allah will grant us a blessing through him. \" She said: \"So I went to him and took him. Nothing prompted me to take him but that I found no one else. \" She said: \"When I took him, I returned with him to my lodging. When I placed him on my lap, my breasts overflowed with as much milk as Allah willed. He drank until he was satisfied, and his (foster) brother drank with him until he was satisfied. Then they both slept, something we had not done with him before. My husband went to that old she-camel of ours, and behold, she was full. He milked from her what he drank and what I drank with him until we were fully satisfied and full. We spent the best of nights. \" She said: \"My companion said to me when we awoke: 'Know, by Allah, O Halima, you have taken a blessed soul!' \" She said: \"I said: 'By Allah, I hope so!' \" She said: \"Then we set out. I rode my donkey and carried him with me. By Allah, she overtook the riders with a speed none of their reddish mounts could equal, until my companions would say to me: 'O daughter of Abi Dhu'ayb, woe to you! Keep pace with us! Is this not the same donkey you set out on?' I would say to them: 'Yes, by Allah, it is indeed the same!' They would say: 'By Allah, she has a story!' \" She said: \"Then we arrived at our homes in the land of the Banu Sa'd, and I know of no land of Allah more barren than it. But my sheep would return to us, after we arrived with him, full of milk. We would milk and drink, while no one else could milk a single drop of milk or find it in the udder. The residents of our tribe would say to their shepherds, 'Woe to you! Graze where the shepherd of the daughter of Abi Dhu'ayb grazes!' Their sheep would return hungry, not yielding a drop of milk, while my sheep returned full of milk. We continued to recognize this increase and goodness from Allah until his two years were complete and I weaned him. He grew rapidly, unlike other boys. Before he reached two years, he was a robust youth. \" She said: \"We brought him back to his mother, while we were most eager for him to stay with us, because of the blessing we had witnessed. We spoke to his mother and I said to her: 'If only you would leave my son with me until he grows stronger, for I fear the plague of Mecca for him.' \" She said: \"We kept appealing to her until she returned him with us. \" Thus, our Master Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained among the Banu Sa'd until, in the fourth or fifth year of his birth, the incident of the splitting of his chest occurred. Muslim reported from Anas: \"That the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was playing with the boys when Gabriel came to him, took him, threw him to the ground, split open his heart, extracted the heart, removed a blood clot from it, and said: 'This is the portion of Satan in you.' Then he washed it in a golden basin with Zamzam water, sealed it, and returned it to its place. The boys came running to his mother – meaning his foster mother – and said: 'Muhammad has been killed!' They met him while his color was pale. To his Affectionate Mother: Halima feared for him after this incident, so she returned him to his mother. He remained with his mother until he reached the age of six. Amina, wanting to fulfill the memory of her late husband, decided to visit his grave in Yathrib. She left Mecca, covering a journey of about five hundred kilometers, accompanied by her orphan son – Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – her maidservant Umm Ayman, and his guardian 'Abdul-Muttalib. She stayed for a month, then returned. While she was on her way back, illness pursued her, pressing hard upon her at the start of the journey, and she died at Al-Abwa, between Mecca and Medina. To his Compassionate Grandfather: 'Abdul-Muttalib returned with him to Mecca. The feelings of tenderness in his heart grew toward his orphan grandson, who had suffered a new calamity that reopened old wounds. He showed him a fondness he had not shown to any of his own children. He did not leave him to his imposed solitude, but preferred him over his own sons. Ibn Hisham said that a mattress was laid out for 'Abdul-Muttalib in the shade of the Kaaba, and his sons would sit around that mattress until he came out to it. None of his sons would sit on it out of reverence for him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), while a robust youth, would come and sit on it. His uncles would try to take him away, but 'Abdul-Muttalib, seeing this, would say: \"Leave my son, for by Allah, he has a great destiny! \" Then he would sit with him on his mattress, wipe his back with his hand, and be pleased with what he saw and did. At eight years, two months, and ten days of age (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), his grandfather 'Abdul-Muttalib died in Mecca. Before his death, he entrusted the care of his grandson to his uncle Abu Talib, his father's full brother. To his Sympathetic Uncle: Abu Talib fulfilled his duty to his nephew in the most perfect way. He included him with his own children, preferred him over them, and showed him special respect and appreciation. For over forty years, he strengthened his position, extended his protection over him, and befriended and antagonized others for his sake. Excerpts of this will come in their respective places. A Life of Hardship: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not have a specific occupation in his early youth, but narrations concur that he used to tend sheep. He herded them among the Banu Sa'd, and in Mecca for its people for a few Qirats. At the age of twenty-five, he traveled as a merchant to Syria with the wealth of Khadija (may Allah be pleased with her). Ibn Ishaq said that Khadija bint Khuwaylid was a noble and wealthy merchant woman who hired men to trade with her money, sharing the profit with them. The Quraysh were a trading people. When she heard about the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – about his truthfulness in speech, his great honesty, and his noble character – she sent for him and offered him to travel to Syria as a merchant with her wealth, and she would give him a better share than she gave others, along with her servant named Maysara. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) accepted her offer and set out with her wealth, accompanied by her servant Maysara, until they reached Syria. His Marriage to Khadija: When he returned to Mecca, Khadija saw in her wealth an honesty and blessing she had not seen before. Her servant Maysara informed her of the pure qualities, noble traits, sound judgment, truthful logic, and trustworthy conduct he had observed in him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). She found her sought-after aspiration – although chiefs and leaders were eager to marry her, she refused them. She confided her feelings to her friend Nafisa bint Munya, who went to him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to propose the marriage to Khadija. He agreed, and he spoke to his uncles, who went to Khadija's uncle and asked for her hand. The marriage was concluded shortly thereafter, two months after his return from Syria. The Banu Hashim and the chiefs of Mudar attended the contract. He gave her a dowry of twenty young she-camels. She was then forty years old and was the best woman of her people in lineage, wealth, and intellect. She was the first woman the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married, and he did not marry anyone else while she was alive until she died. All his children (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) were from her, except Ibrahim. She first bore him Al-Qasim – by whom he was nicknamed (Abu al-Qasim) – then Zaynab, Ruqayya, Umm Kulthum, Fatima, and 'Abdullah. 'Abdullah was nicknamed At-Tayyib (the Good) and At-Tahir (the Pure). All his sons died in their infancy. As for his daughters, all of them reached Islam, embraced it, and emigrated, but they all passed away during his lifetime (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), except for Fatima (may Allah be pleased with her), who survived him by six months, then joined him. The Building of the Kaaba and the Arbitration Issue: In the thirty-fifth year of his birth (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Quraysh undertook the rebuilding of the Kaaba. This was because the Kaaba was merely a pile of stones, a little taller than a man (about nine cubits high) since the time of Isma'il, and it had no roof. A group of thieves had stolen the treasure inside it. Furthermore, being an ancient structure, it had been exposed to elements that damaged its building and cracked its walls. Five years before his Prophetic Mission (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a massive flood swept through Mecca and flowed into the Sacred House, nearly causing the Kaaba to collapse. The Quraysh were compelled to renovate its structure, out of concern for its status. They agreed not to include anything in its construction except what was lawfully earned (good\/pure money), excluding a harlot's dowry, the profit from usurious sales, or the money from any injustice. They were hesitant to tear it down, but Al-Walid ibn Al-Mughira Al-Makhzumi started the demolition, and the people followed him when they saw that no harm befell him. They continued demolishing until they reached the foundations of Ibrahim. Then they wanted to start building. They divided the Kaaba and allocated a section to each tribe. Each tribe collected stones separately and began building. A Roman builder named Baqoum oversaw the construction. When the building reached the spot of the Black Stone, they disputed over who would have the honor of placing it in its position. The dispute lasted four or five nights and intensified until it nearly turned into a fierce war in the Sacred Precinct. However, Abu Umayya ibn Al-Mughira Al-Makhzumi proposed that they take as an arbiter the first person to enter upon them from the gate of the Mosque. They agreed. By the will of Allah, it was the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When they saw him, they exclaimed: \"This is Al-Amin (the Trustworthy)! We accept him! This is Muhammad! \" When he reached them and they informed him of the situation, he asked for a cloak. He placed the Stone in its center and asked the chiefs of the disputing tribes to all hold the edges of the cloak. He ordered them to lift it. When they had raised it to its designated spot, he took it with his hand and placed it in its position. This was a wise solution that satisfied the people. The legitimate funds of the Quraysh fell short, so they excluded from the northern side about six cubits, which is called Al-Hijr and Al-Hatim. They raised the door from the ground so that only those they wished could enter it. When the building reached fifteen cubits in height, they roofed it with six columns. After its completion, the Kaaba had an approximately square shape, with a height of 15 meters. The length of the side with the Black Stone and the opposite side was 10.10 meters, and the Stone was placed at a height of 1.50 meters from the floor of the circumambulation area. The length of the side with the door and the opposite side was 12 meters, and its door was two meters above the ground. It is surrounded on the outside, at its base, by a low wall of masonry called Ash-Shadharwan, with an average height of 0.25 meters and an average width of 0.30 meters. This was part of the original House, but the Quraysh left it out. Summary of the Biography Before Prophethood: Our Master Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had gathered in his upbringing the best qualities of all people. He was a refined model of sound thinking, keen insight, and possessed a large share of good judgment, originality of thought, and correctness of means and purpose. He used his long silence for deep contemplation, constant reflection, and the search for truth. With his fertile mind and pure nature, he read the pages of life, the affairs of people, and the conditions of communities. He rejected the superstitions outside of that and kept away from them. Then he associated with people with a clear understanding of his own situation and theirs. What he found good, he participated in, otherwise he returned to his accustomed seclusion. He did not drink wine, nor eat what was slaughtered for idols, nor attend any festival or celebration for the idols. Rather, from the beginning of his youth, he naturally disliked these false deities, to the extent that nothing was more hateful to him than them, and he could not bear to hear anyone swear by Al-Lat and Al-Uzza. There is no doubt that Destiny surrounded him with protection. Whenever the desires of the soul prompted him to explore some worldly pleasures, and whenever he might have been inclined to follow some disapproved traditions, divine care intervened to prevent him. Ibn Al-Athir reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"I never intended to do anything that the people of the pre-Islamic era (Jahiliyya) used to do, except for two times, and in both cases, Allah prevented me from it. Then I never intended to do it again until He honored me with His Message. \" He said: \"One night I said to the youth who was herding sheep with me in upper Mecca, 'If you would watch my sheep for me, I would enter Mecca and spend the evening there as young men do.' He replied, 'I will do so.' So I went out. When I reached the first house in Mecca, I heard music. I asked, 'What is this?' They said, 'It is the wedding of so-and-so to so-and-so.' I sat down to listen, but Allah struck my ears (with a deep sleep), and I slept. Nothing woke me but the heat of the sun. I returned to my companion, who asked me, and I informed him. The next night, I said the same thing and entered Mecca, and the same thing happened to me as the first night. After that, I never intended to do any evil. \" Al-Bukhari reported from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah: \"When the Kaaba was being built, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and 'Abbas were carrying stones. 'Abbas said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), 'Put your lower garment on your neck to protect you from the stones.' He fainted to the ground, his eyes fixed on the sky. When he recovered, he said: 'My garment! My garment!' He then tied his garment around himself. \" In another narration, \"His private parts were never seen after that. \" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was distinguished among his people by his gentle manners, noble character, and generous qualities. He was the most noble of his people in chivalry, the best in character, the most protective of his neighbors, the most patient, the most truthful in speech, the most easygoing, the most chaste, the most generous in goodness, the most righteous in action, the most faithful to his covenants, and the most trustworthy, to the extent that his people called him \"Al-Amin \" (The Trustworthy) for all the righteous conditions and praiseworthy qualities he possessed. He was, as the Mother of the Believers Khadija (may Allah be pleased with her) said, one who bore the burdens of the weak, earned for the destitute, honored the guest, and assisted in calamities that struck the truth. In the Shadow of Prophethood and Message: In the Cave of Hira: When he approached the age of forty (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his past contemplations had widened the intellectual gap between him and his people, he began to love seclusion. He would take *sawiq* (a type of groats) and water and go to the Cave of Hira on Mount An-Nur (Mount of Light), about two miles from Mecca – a small cave, four cubits long and one and three-quarter iron cubits wide – with his family nearby. He would stay there for the month of Ramadan, feed the poor who came to him, and spend his time in worship and contemplation of the surrounding cosmic scenes and the creative power behind them. He was not satisfied with the flimsy polytheistic beliefs and weak conceptions of his people, but he had no clear path, no defined methodology, and no direct way before him that he could trust and approve. His choice of this isolation (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was part of Allah's planning for him, to prepare him for the great matter that awaited him. Any soul destined to influence the reality of human life and turn it in another direction... that soul needs a period of solitude and isolation, a withdrawal from worldly preoccupations, the noise of life, and the small concerns of people that occupy life. Thus, Allah prepared our Master Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as He readied him to carry the great trust, to change the face of the Earth, and to modify the course of history... He arranged this isolation for him three years before entrusting him with the Message. He would spend a month in this seclusion, communing with the free spirit of existence, contemplating the hidden unseen beyond existence, until the time came for interaction with this unseen when Allah permitted it. Gabriel Descends with the Revelation: When he completed forty years – the age of perfection, and it is said: the age at which Messengers are sent – the signs of Prophethood began to glimmer and shine for him from beyond the horizons of life. These signs were true dreams. He would not see a dream that did not come true like the break of dawn. This lasted for six months – the duration of Prophethood being twenty-three years, so this dream was one part out of forty-six parts of Prophethood. When Ramadan came in the third year of his isolation (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Hira, Allah willed to pour out His mercy upon the inhabitants of the Earth. He honored him with Prophethood, and Gabriel descended to him with verses of the Qur'an. Upon review and reflection on the circumstantial evidence and proofs, we can determine that day to be Monday, the night of the twenty-first of Ramadan, corresponding to August 10, 610 AD. His age (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was exactly forty lunar years, six months, and 12 days, which is approximately 39 solar years, three months, and 12 days. Let us listen to 'A'isha As-Siddiqah (may Allah the Most High be pleased with her) narrate to us the story of this event, which was a spark of divine light that began to open the dark shadows of disbelief and error, changing the course of life and altering the path of history. 'A'isha (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The beginning of the Revelation vouchsafed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the true dream in sleep. He would not see a dream that did not come true like the break of dawn. Then seclusion became dear to him. He used to seclude himself in the Cave of Hira, where he engaged in *tahannuth* – which is worship – for a number of nights before returning to his family. He would take provision for that, then return to Khadija to take provision for a similar period. This continued until the Truth came to him while he was in the Cave of Hira. The Angel came to him and said: \"Read! \" I said: \"I am not a reader. \" He said: \"He seized me and squeezed me until I was utterly exhausted, then he released me and said: 'Read!' \" I said: \"I am not a reader. \" He seized me and squeezed me a third time, then he released me and said: {READ IN THE NAME OF YOUR LORD WHO CREATED, * CREATED MAN FROM A CLINGING SUBSTANCE. * READ! AND YOUR LORD IS THE MOST GENEROUS.} [Al-'Alaq: 1-3]. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) returned with it, his heart trembling. He entered upon Khadija bint Khuwaylid and said: \"Cover me! Cover me! \" They covered him until the fear left him. He said to Khadija: \"What is wrong with me? \" and he informed her of the news: \"I feared for myself. \" Khadija responded: \"Nay, by Allah, Allah will never disgrace you! You maintain kinship ties, you bear the burdens of the weak, you earn for the destitute, you honor the guest, and you assist in the calamities that strike the truth. \" Khadija took him until she brought him to Waraqa ibn Nawfal ibn Asad ibn 'Abdul-'Uzza, Khadija's cousin, who had become a Christian in the pre-Islamic era. He used to write the Hebrew script, writing from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah willed him to write. He was a very old man who had gone blind. Khadija said to him: \"O cousin, listen to your nephew. \" Waraqa said to him: \"O my nephew, what do you see? \" The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) informed him of what he had seen. Waraqa said to him: \"This is the Namus (the Angel of Revelation) that Allah sent down to Moses. Oh, would that I were a young man then! Would that I were alive when your people expel you! \" The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked: \"Will they expel me? \" He replied: \"Yes. Never has a man brought what you have brought except that he was opposed. And if your day overtakes me, I will support you strongly. \" Soon after, Waraqa died, and the Revelation ceased temporarily. At-Tabari and Ibn Hisham reported what indicates that he left the Cave of Hira after being surprised by the Revelation, then returned and completed his seclusion, and after that, returned to Mecca. The narration of At-Tabari sheds light on the reason for his leaving, and this is its text: Our Master Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said after mentioning the coming of the Revelation: \"Nothing created by Allah was more hateful to me than a poet or a madman. I could not bear to look at them. \" He said: \"I said to myself: 'This distant one (meaning himself) is either a poet or a madman. The Quraysh will talk about it forever. I will deliberately go to a high cliff of the mountain and throw myself from it to kill myself and find rest.' \" He said: \"I went out intending that. When I was halfway up the mountain, I heard a voice from the sky saying: 'O Muhammad! You are the Messenger of Allah, and I am Gabriel!' \" He said: \"I raised my head to the sky, and behold, Gabriel was in the form of a man, standing with his feet at the horizon of the sky, saying: 'O Muhammad! You are the Messenger of Allah, and I am Gabriel!' \" He said: \"I stood still, looking at him, and that distracted me from what I intended. I did not move forward or backward. I started turning my face away in the horizons of the sky, but I did not look in any direction but saw him like that. I remained standing, neither advancing nor retreating, until Khadija sent her messengers to look for me. They reached Mecca and returned to her, while I was still standing in my place. \" He said: \"Then he turned away from me, and I returned to my family. When I came to Khadija, I sat on her thigh, leaning against her. \" She said: \"O Abul-Qasim, where have you been? By Allah, I sent people to look for you until they reached Mecca and returned to me! \" Then he told her what he had seen. She said: \"Rejoice, O cousin, and be firm! By Him in Whose Hand is Khadija's soul, I hope that you will be the Prophet of this Nation! \" Then she got up and went to Waraqa and informed him. He said: \"Holy! Holy! By Him in Whose Hand is Waraqa's soul, the Greater Namus (Angel of Revelation) that came to Moses has come to him! He is the Prophet of this Nation! Tell him to be firm! \" Khadija returned and informed him of Waraqa's words. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) completed his seclusion and returned to Mecca, Waraqa met him and, after hearing his story, said: \"By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, you are the Prophet of this Nation! And the Greater Namus that came to Moses has come to you! \" The Period of Interruption of Revelation (*Fatra*): As for the duration of the interruption of the Revelation (*Fatra*), Ibn Sa'd reported from Ibn 'Abbas what suggests it lasted for a few days, and this is the most likely and even certain view after considering all aspects. The widespread notion that it lasted for three years or two and a half years is by no means correct, and this is not the place for a detailed refutation. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained sad and grieved during the days of *Fatra*, afflicted by confusion and astonishment. Al-Bukhari reported in the Book of Interpretation of Dreams: \"The Revelation ceased for a period, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) grieved, as reached us, a grief that led him to attempt several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains. Whenever he reached a mountain peak to throw himself off, Gabriel would appear to him and say: 'O Muhammad, you are truly the Messenger of Allah.' This would soothe his heart and calm his soul, and he would return. If the interruption of the Revelation lengthened, he would go out to do the same, and whenever he reached the mountain peak, Gabriel would appear to him and say the same thing. \" Gabriel Descends with the Revelation a Second Time: Ibn Hajar said: \"This interruption (of the Revelation for a few days) was to dispel the fear the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had felt and to generate in him the longing for its return. \" When the shadows of confusion receded, the signs of truth were established, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) knew with certainty that he had become a Prophet of Allah, the Great, the Exalted, and that what came to him was the Ambassador of the Revelation conveying news from Heaven, his longing and anticipation for the return of the Revelation became the reason for his firmness and endurance when it returned. Gabriel came to him a second time. Al-Bukhari reported from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) speak about the *Fatra* of the Revelation. He said: \"While I was walking, I heard a voice from the sky. I raised my gaze towards the sky, and behold, the Angel who had come to me in Hira was sitting on a throne between the heaven and the earth. I was so overwhelmed by him that I fell to the ground. I came to my family and said, 'Cover me! Cover me!' So they covered me. Then Allah the Most High revealed: {O you who is wrapped up (in a mantle)!} to His saying: {And abandon the abomination}, and after that, the Revelation became intense and successive. \" Digression on the Categories of Revelation: Before detailing the life of the Message and the Prophethood, we believe it is appropriate to understand the categories of the Revelation, which is the source of the Message and the support of the Call. Ibn Al-Qayyim – mentioning the ranks of the Revelation – said: The first: The true dream, which was the beginning of his Revelation (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The second: What the Angel cast into his heart and soul without him seeing him, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"The Holy Spirit has breathed into my soul that no soul shall die until it has completed its provision, so fear Allah, and be moderate in seeking (provision). Let not the delay in provision lead you to seek it by disobeying Allah, for what is with Allah cannot be attained except through obedience to Him. \" The third: The Angel would materialize for him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the form of a man and speak to him until he understood what he said. At this rank, the Companions would sometimes see him. The fourth: The Revelation would come to him like the ringing of a bell. This was the hardest upon him, and the Angel would cling to him, so much so that his forehead would profusely sweat on an intensely cold day, and his riding animal would kneel to the ground if he was riding it. The Revelation once came to him like this while his thigh was upon Zayd ibn Thabit's thigh, and it became so heavy that it almost crushed it. The fifth: He would see the Angel in his original form in which he was created, and he would reveal to him what Allah willed to reveal. This happened to him twice, as Allah mentioned in Surat An-Najm. The sixth: What Allah revealed to him while he was above the heavens on the Night of Al-Mi'raj (Ascension), such as the prescribing of the prayer and other matters. The seventh: Allah's speech to him directly, without the mediation of an angel, just as Allah spoke to Moses ibn 'Imran. This rank is definitely established for Moses by the text of the Qur'an. Its establishment for our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is in the narration of Al-Isra' (The Night Journey). Some have added an eighth rank, which is Allah speaking to him face-to-face without a veil, but this is a matter of difference of opinion between the predecessors and the later scholars. End of quote, with a slight summary in explaining the first and eighth ranks. The Command to Commence the Call (Da'wa): The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) received several commands in the word of Allah the Most High: {O YOU WHO IS WRAPPED UP (IN A MANTLE)! * ARISE AND WARN! * AND YOUR LORD, MAGNIFY! * AND YOUR GARMENTS, PURIFY! * AND ABANDON THE ABOMINATION! * AND DO NOT GIVE, EXPECTING MORE IN RETURN! * AND FOR YOUR LORD, BE PATIENT!} [Al-Muddaththir: 1-7]. Commands that are seemingly simple and naive, but far-reaching in scope and purpose, and powerful in effect and reality. The purpose of the warning is not to leave anyone in existence who opposes Allah's pleasure without warning him of its grave consequences, until a tremor and earthquake occur in his heart and soul. The purpose of magnifying the Lord is not to leave any arrogance on Earth without breaking its power and turning it upside down, so that nothing remains on Earth but the majesty of Allah the Most High. The purpose of purifying garments and abandoning abomination is to reach a degree of perfection in purifying the exterior and the interior, and in purifying the soul from all impurities and defilements, as much as is possible for a human soul under the sheltering shade of Allah's mercy, His preservation, His care, His guidance, and His light, so that he may be the highest example in human society, attracting sound hearts and inspiring awe and grandeur in misguided hearts, until the entire world revolves around him, whether in agreement or disagreement. The purpose of not seeking to gain more by giving is not to consider one's actions and efforts as grandiose and great. Rather, one should continue striving action after action, exerting much effort, sacrifice, and self-annihilation, then forget all of that, being absorbed in the consciousness of Allah to the extent that one does not feel or perceive what one has given and accomplished. The last verse is a reference to the harm he will face from the opponents, ranging from opposition, mockery, and ridicule, to serious efforts to kill him and his Companions, and to eliminate all the believers who gathered around him. Allah the Most High commands him to endure all of this with strength and fortitude, not for the sake of any worldly gain, but solely for the pleasure of his Lord. Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest)! How simple these commands are in their apparent form, and how wonderful they are in their calm, captivating rhythms! But how great, majestic, and demanding they are in action, and how powerfully they stir up a raging storm that encompasses all sides of the world, leaving them to clash with one another. The verses themselves contain the substance of the Call and the transmission of the Message. The warning itself necessitates that there are actions with a bad consequence that their doers will face. Given that everyone knows that the world does not fully reward or punish people for all their actions, the warning necessitates a Day of Requital separate from the days of this world, which is called the Day of Resurrection, the Day of Recompense and Judgment (*Ad-Din*). This requires a life other than the one we live in this world. The remaining verses demand pure Monotheism (Tawhid) from the servants, the submission of all matters to Allah the Most High, and the forsaking of the pleasure of the self and the pleasure of the servants for the pleasure of Allah the Most High. Thus, these points are summarized in: a – Monotheism (Tawhid). b – Belief in the Last Day. c – The purification of the soul by refraining from wrongdoings and indecencies that lead to an evil end, and by acquiring virtues, perfections, and good deeds. d – The submission of all matters to Allah the Most High. e – All of this subsequent to belief in the Message of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and under his noble leadership and wise guidance. Furthermore, the beginning of the verses contained the elevated summons – in the voice of the Great, the Exalted – commissioning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for this tremendous task, pulling him from sleep, wrapping, and warmth into struggle, battle, and hardship: {O YOU WHO IS WRAPPED UP! * ARISE AND WARN!}... It is as if it was said: 'He who lives for himself may live in comfort. But you, who bear this great burden, what business do you have with sleep? What business do you have with rest? What business do you have with the warm bed, the quiet life, and the comfortable enjoyment? Arise for the great matter that awaits you, and the heavy burden prepared for you! Arise for the effort and toil, the struggle and fatigue! Arise, for the time of sleep and rest is over! From this day forth, there is only continuous vigilance and a long, arduous struggle! Arise, prepare yourself and be ready for this matter!' It is a great and formidable word that draws him from the warmth of the bed in the quiet house and the warm embrace to push him into the midst of the chaos, between gales and storms, and between the push and pull in people's consciences and in the reality of life alike. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) arose and remained standing for more than twenty years thereafter, never resting or settling down, and never living for himself or his family. He arose and remained standing for the Call of Allah. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) carried on his shoulders the heavy, crushing burden without giving way to it: the burden of the greatest trust on this Earth, the burden of all humanity, the burden of the entire creed, and the burden of struggle and jihad in various fields. He lived in the constant, ongoing battle for more than twenty years, with no concern distracting him from another during this period, ever since he heard the majestic heavenly call and received the terrifying commission. May Allah reward him best on our behalf and on behalf of all humanity. The following pages are but a simple, miniature depiction of this long, arduous struggle carried out by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during that period. The Stages and Phases of the Call (*Da'wa*): We can divide the era of the Muhammadan Call – upon its author be peace, blessings, and salutations – into two periods, each distinctly separated from the other: The Meccan Period: Approximately thirteen years. The Medinan Period: Ten full years. Each of these two periods comprises phases, each with distinguishing characteristics, which become clear after careful observation of the circumstances through which the Call passed during both periods. The Meccan Period can be divided into three phases: The Phase of the Secret Call: Three years. The Phase of the Public Declaration of the Call to the People of Mecca: From the beginning of the fourth year of Prophethood to the end of the tenth year. The Phase of the Call Outside Mecca and its Spread Among Them: From the end of the tenth year of Prophethood until his Emigration (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to Medina. As for the phases of the Medinan Period, they will be detailed in their appropriate place. Phase One – The Struggle of the Call Three Years of the Secret Call: It is well known that Mecca was the center of the Arabs' religion. It had the custodians of the Kaaba and the guardians of the idols and statues sacred to all Arabs. Thus, achieving the goal of reform there was more difficult and intense than if it were far away. The matter required a resolve that would not be shaken by calamities and disasters. Hence, it was wise for the Call to be secret in its beginning, so as not to surprise the people of Mecca and provoke them. The First Rank (*Ar-Ra'il Al-Awwal*): It was natural for the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to first present Islam to the people closest to him: his household and his friends. He invited them to Islam, and he invited everyone he considered good among those he knew and who knew him—whom he knew for their love of truth and goodness, and who knew him for his commitment to honesty and righteousness. A group of these people responded to him—those who never had a shadow of a doubt about the greatness of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the nobility of his soul, and the truthfulness of his news. They are known in Islamic history as The First Precursors (As-Sabiqun Al-Awwalun). At the forefront were his wife, the Mother of the Believers Khadija bint Khuwaylid, his freed slave Zayd ibn Thabit ibn Shurahbil Al-Kalbi, his cousin 'Ali ibn Abi Talib – who was a young boy under the Messenger's guardianship – and his close friend Abu Bakr As-Siddiq. These embraced Islam on the very first day of the Call. Then Abu Bakr became active in inviting to Islam. He was a friendly, beloved, and easygoing man, possessing good character and kindness. The men of his people would come to him and enjoy his company due to his knowledge, his trade, and his good companionship. He began inviting those of his people whom he trusted, who frequented him and sat with him. Through his invitation, 'Uthman ibn 'Affan Al-Umawi, Az-Zubayr ibn Al-'Awwam Al-Asadi, 'Abdul-Rahman ibn 'Awf, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas Az-Zuhriyyani, and Talha ibn 'Ubaydullah At-Taymi embraced Islam. These eight individuals who preceded others were the First Rank and the vanguard of Islam. Among the early Muslims were Bilal ibn Rabah Al-Habashi (the Abyssinian), followed by the Trustworthy of this Nation, Abu 'Ubayda 'Amir ibn Al-Jarrah from the Banu Al-Harith ibn Fihr, Abu Salama ibn 'Abdul-Asad, Al-Arqam ibn Abi Al-Arqam Al-Makhzumiyyan, 'Uthman ibn Maz'un and his two brothers Qudama and 'Abdullah, 'Ubayda ibn Al-Harith ibn Al-Muttalib ibn 'Abd Manaf, Sa'id ibn Zayd Al-'Adawi, and his wife Fatima bint Al-Khattab Al-'Adawiyya, the sister of 'Umar ibn Al-Khattab, Khabbab ibn Al-Aratt, 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud Al-Hudhali, and others. These were the First Precursors, coming from all the clans of Quraysh. Ibn Hisham counted them as more than forty individuals, although the inclusion of some of them among the First Precursors is subject to deliberation. Ibn Ishaq said: \"Then people entered Islam in groups, men and women, until the mention of Islam spread in Mecca and became a topic of conversation. \" These individuals embraced Islam secretly. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would meet with them and guide them to the religion in concealment, as the Call was still individual and secret. The Revelation had become continuous and intense after the descent of the initial verses of Al-Muddaththir. The verses and sections of Surahs revealed during this time were short, with brilliant, powerful breaks (at the ends of verses), and calm, captivating rhythms, consistent with that gentle, whispering atmosphere. They emphasized the betterment and purification of the souls and condemned their contamination with worldly desires. They described Paradise and Hell as though seen with the naked eye, leading the believers into an atmosphere different from the one prevailing in human society at that time. The Prayer (*Salat*): Among the first things revealed was the command for prayer. Muqatil ibn Sulayman said: \"In the beginning of Islam, Allah made obligatory the prayer of two units (*rak'at*) in the morning and two units in the evening, \" based on the words of Allah the Most High: {AND EXALT WITH THE PRAISE OF YOUR LORD IN THE EVENING AND IN THE EARLY MORNING.} [Ghafir: 55]. Ibn Hajar said: \"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) certainly used to pray before the *Isra'* (Night Journey), and so did his Companions, but there is a difference of opinion as to whether anything from the prayers was obligated before the Five Prayers. It was said that the obligation was a prayer before sunrise and a prayer before sunset. \" End of quote. Al-Harith ibn Usama reported through the chain of Ibn Lahi'ah, connected to Zayd ibn Haritha, that when the Revelation was first made to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Gabriel came to him and taught him the ablution (*Wudu'*). When he finished the ablution, he took a handful of water and sprinkled his private parts with it. Ibn Majah reported a similar meaning. A similar account is reported from Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib and Ibn 'Abbas, and in the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, \"This was among the first obligations. \" Ibn Hisham mentioned that when the time for prayer came, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions would go into the ravines and conceal their prayer from their people. Abu Talib once saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and 'Ali praying and spoke to them about it, but when he understood the reality of the matter, he ordered them to be firm. The News Reaches the Quraysh Generally: It appears from a review of various aspects of the events that the Call (*Da'wa*) – even though it was secret and individual at this stage – had reached the Quraysh, yet they did not pay much attention to it. Sheikh Muhammad Al-Ghazali said: \"These reports reached the Quraysh, but they did not heed them. Perhaps they considered Muhammad one of those religious men who spoke about divinity and its rights, as Umayya ibn Abi As-Salt, Quss ibn Sa'ida, 'Amr ibn Nufayl, and their like had done. However, they were wary of his news spreading and his influence extending, and they began to watch the fate of him and his Call over time. \" Three years passed, and the Call remained secret and individual. During this period, a group of believers was formed, built upon brotherhood, cooperation, the transmission of the Message, and its establishment. Then the Revelation descended, commissioning the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to openly challenge his people, confront their falsehood, and attack their idols. Phase Two – The Public Call The First Command to Proclaim the Call: The first thing revealed in this regard was the word of Allah the Most High: {AND WARN YOUR NEAREST KINSMEN.} [Ash-Shu'ara: 214]. The Surah in which this verse occurs – Surah Ash-Shu'ara – first mentions the story of Moses (peace be upon him), from the beginning of his prophethood until his emigration with the Children of Israel, their rescue from Pharaoh and his people, and the drowning of Pharaoh's people with him. This story included all the phases Moses (peace be upon him) went through during his call of Pharaoh and his people to Allah. It should be noted that this detail was brought when the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was commanded to call his people to Allah, so that he and his Companions would have a model of the denial and persecution they would face when proclaiming the Call, and so that they would be aware of their situation from the beginning of their Call. On the other hand, this Surah mentions the destiny of those who denied the Messengers: the people of Noah, 'Ad, Thamud, the people of Ibrahim, the people of Lot, and the Dwellers of Al-Ayka – in addition to the account of Pharaoh and his people – so that those who were about to deny would know the outcome of their affair and the punishment of Allah they would face if they persisted in denial, and so that the believers would know that the good outcome was for them, not for the deniers. The Call to the Nearest Kinsmen: The first thing our Master Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did after the revelation of this verse was to summon the Banu Hashim. They gathered, along with some men from the Banu Al-Muttalib ibn 'Abd Manaf, totaling forty-five men. Abu Lahab immediately preempted him and said: \"These are your paternal uncles and your cousins, so speak and leave the boys. Know that your people, among all the Arabs, do not have the strength to face this. And I am the most worthy of taking care of you. The sons of your father are enough for you. If you persist in what you are doing, it will be easier for them for the clans of the Quraysh to attack you and for the Arabs to support them, than for you to bring upon the sons of your father something worse than what you have brought. \" The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent and did not speak at that gathering. Then he invited them a second time and said: \"All praise is due to Allah. I praise Him, seek His help, believe in Him, and rely upon Him. And I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, alone, with no partner. \" Then he said: \"A scout does not lie to his people. By Allah, other than Whom there is no god, I am the Messenger of Allah to you specifically and to mankind generally. By Allah, you will surely die as you sleep, and you will surely be resurrected as you wake up, and you will surely be held accountable for what you do. It will be Paradise forever or the Fire forever. \" Abu Talib said: \"How much we desire to assist you, how readily we accept your advice, and how strongly we believe in your words! These are the sons of your father, gathered here. I am but one of them, but I am the quickest to do what you love. Proceed with what you have been commanded. By Allah, I will continue to protect and defend you, but my soul does not allow me to abandon the religion of 'Abdul-Muttalib. \" Abu Lahab said: \"By Allah, this is a disgrace! Take him before others do! \" Abu Talib said: \"By Allah, we will defend him as long as we live. \" On Mount As-Safa: After the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was assured of Abu Talib's commitment to protect him as he conveyed his Lord's message, he stood one day on As-Safa and cried out: \"Ya Sabahah! \" (A morning alarm cry). The clans of the Quraysh gathered around him. He called them to Monotheism, belief in his Message, and the Last Day. Al-Bukhari reported a part of this story from Ibn 'Abbas, who said: \"When {AND WARN YOUR NEAREST KINSMEN} was revealed, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ascended As-Safa and began calling out: 'O Banu Fihr...! O Banu 'Adiyy!' – to the clans of the Quraysh – until they gathered. A man who could not come sent a messenger to see what the matter was. Abu Lahab and the Quraysh came. He said: 'If I were to tell you that cavalry is in the valley, intending to raid you, would you believe me?' They said: 'Yes, we have never known anything from you but truthfulness.' He said: 'Then I am a Warner to you before a severe torment.' Abu Lahab said: 'Perish you for the rest of the day! Is this why you gathered us?' Then {MAY THE HANDS OF ABU LAHAB BE RUINED, AND MAY HE BE RUINED!} [Al-Masad: 1] was revealed.\" Muslim narrated another part of this story on the authority of Abû Hurayra, may Allah be pleased with him. He said: When this verse was revealed: {AND WARN YOUR CLOSEST KINDRED} [Ash-Shu'ara': 214], the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called out generally and specifically. He said: \"O people of Quraysh, save yourselves from the Fire! O people of Banû Ka'b, save yourselves from the Fire! O Fâtima, daughter of Muhammad, save yourself from the Fire! For by Allah, I possess nothing for you from Allah, except that you have a kinship which I shall maintain (lit. keep it moist with its moisture). \" This loud cry is the utmost proclamation. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made it clear to the people closest to him that believing in this Message is the lifeblood of the connection between him and them, and that the tribal solidarity based on kinship, on which the Arabs relied, melted away in the heat of this warning coming from Allah. * The Proclamation of the Truth and the Reactions of the Polytheists: This voice did not cease its reverberation throughout Makkah until the saying of the Almighty was revealed: {THEREFORE PROCLAIM WHAT YOU ARE COMMANDED, AND TURN AWAY FROM THE POLYTHEISTS} [Al-Hijr: 94]. Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up, challenging the superstitions and absurdities of polytheism (Shirk). He spoke of the reality of the idols and their true worthlessness, citing examples of their incapacity, and clearly demonstrating that whoever worships them and takes them as a means between himself and Allah is in manifest error. Makkah erupted with feelings of anger and was stirred by astonishment and denunciation when it heard a voice openly proclaiming the error of the polytheists and idol-worshippers, as if it were a thunderbolt striking the cloud, causing thunder, lightning, and shaking the peaceful atmosphere. Quraysh prepared to resolve this revolution that had suddenly erupted, fearing that it might destroy its traditions and inheritance. They rose because they knew that the meaning of Faith entailed the denial of divinity for anything other than Allah, and that the meaning of Faith in the Message and the Last Day was complete surrender and absolute delegation (to Allah), such that they would have no choice concerning their persons and their wealth, let alone others. This meant the eradication of their sovereignty and arrogance over the Arabs, which was religious in nature, and their inability to fulfill their desires in the face of the pleasure of Allah and His Messenger, as well as their inability to commit the injustices they inflicted upon the lower classes, and the evil deeds they perpetrated morning and evening. They understood this meaning, and their souls refused to accept this disgraceful state, not out of honor or goodness, but rather: {BUT MAN WANTS TO PERSIST IN HIS WICKEDNESS BEFORE HIM} [Al-Qiyâmah: 5]. They understood all of this very well, but what would they do in the face of a truthful, trustworthy man, the highest example of human values and noble morals, for whom they had known no parallel or equal throughout a long period of the history of their fathers and peoples? What would they do? They were perplexed, and they had every right to be. After considering their options, they found no way but to approach his uncle, Abû Tâlib, and ask him to restrain his nephew from what he was doing. To give their request a semblance of seriousness and truth, they decided to say: \"The call to abandon their deities, and the claim that they have no benefit or power, is a foul insult and a severe humiliation for them, and it involves disparagement and misguidance for their fathers who were upon this religion. \" They found this path and hastened to take it. * -Quraysh's Delegation to Abû Tâlib: Ibn Is-hâq said: Men from the nobles of Quraysh walked to Abû Tâlib and said: \"O Abû Tâlib, your nephew has insulted our gods, criticized our religion, mocked our intellect, and declared our fathers misguided. Either restrain him from us, or leave us to deal with him, for you are in disagreement with him just as we are, and we will rid you of him. \" Abû Tâlib spoke to them gently and sent them away kindly. They departed from him, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) continued as he was, manifesting the religion of Allah and calling to it. * The Consultative Council to Prevent Pilgrims from Hearing the Call: During these days, another matter concerned Quraysh. The open proclamation of the Message had only lasted a few months before the Hajj season approached. Quraysh knew that the Arab delegations would arrive. So, they deemed it necessary to have a word to say to the Arabs concerning Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) so that his message would not have an effect on the souls of the Arabs. They gathered to Al-Walîd ibn Al-Mughîrah to deliberate on that word. Al-Walîd said to them: \"Agree upon a single opinion, and do not differ, lest some of you belie others, and your words contradict each other. \" They said: \"Then you speak. \" He said: \"Rather, you speak, and I will listen. \" They said: \"We say: (He is) a soothsayer (Kâhin). \" He said: \"No, by Allah, he is not a soothsayer. We have seen soothsayers, and he has neither the soothsayer's murmur nor his rhymed prose. \" They said: \"Then we say: (He is) mad (Majnûn). \" He said: \"He is not mad. We have seen and known madness. He has none of its choking, its convulsions, or its whispering. \" They said: \"Then we say: (He is) a poet (Shâ'ir). \" He said: \"He is not a poet. We have known all poetry: its *Rajaz*, its *Hajaz*, its *Qarîd* (composed), its *Maqbûd* (contracted), and its *Mabsût* (extended), and it is not poetry. \" They said: \"Then we say: (He is) a sorcerer (Sâhir). \" He said: \"He is not a sorcerer. We have seen sorcerers and their magic. He has neither their blowing nor their knots. \" They said: \"Then what should we say? \" He said: \"By Allah, his speech has a sweetness, its root is a rich branch (of fruit), and its top is full of produce. You will not say anything of this except that it will be known to be false. The closest statement to the truth is to say: 'He is a sorcerer who came with a word that is magic, by which he separates a man from his father, a man from his brother, a man from his wife, and a man from his clan.' \" They dispersed from him based on this. Some narrations indicate that when Al-Walîd rejected everything they proposed, they said: \"Show us your opinion that is flawless. \" He said to them: \"Give me time to think about it. \" Al-Walîd continued to think until he presented to them the opinion mentioned earlier. It was concerning Al-Walîd that Allah the Almighty revealed sixteen verses of Sûrat Al-Muddaththir, depicting the manner of his thinking: {INDEED, HE THOUGHT AND MADE A DETERMINATION. * SO CURSED IS HE, HOW HE DETERMINED! * AND AGAIN, CURSED IS HE, HOW HE DETERMINED! * THEN HE LOOKED. * THEN HE FROWNED AND LOOKER SOURLY. * THEN HE TURNED AWAY AND WAS ARROGANT. * AND SAID, \"THIS IS NOT BUT MAGIC INHERITED [FROM OTHERS]. * THIS IS NOT BUT THE WORD OF A MORTAL. \" } [Al-Muddaththir: 18-25]. After the council agreed on this decision, they began to implement it. They sat on the routes of the people when they arrived for the season. No one passed by them except that they warned him against him and mentioned his matter to them. The one who took the lead in this was Abû Lahab. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would follow the people when they arrived for the season in their dwellings, at 'Ukâdh, Majannah, and Dhû Al-Majâz, calling them to Allah, and Abû Lahab would be behind him saying: \"Do not obey him, for he is a Sabian, a liar. \" This resulted in the Arabs leaving that season informed about the matter of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his mention spread throughout all the lands of the Arabs. * Various Methods to Confront the Call: When Quraysh saw that neither this nor that deterred Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from his Message, they thought again and chose methods to suppress this call, which are summarized as follows: * Scoffing and belittlement, ridicule, denial, and jesting, intended to discourage the Muslims and weaken their morale. They hurled frivolous accusations and foolish insults at the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). They called him mad: {AND THEY SAY, \"O YOU UPON WHOM THE REMINDER HAS BEEN SENT DOWN, INDEED, YOU ARE MAD. \"} [Al-Hijr: 6]. They labeled him with magic and falsehood: {AND THEY WONDERED THAT THERE HAD COME TO THEM A WARNER FROM AMONG THEMSELVES; AND THE DISBELIEVERS SAID, \"THIS IS A MAGICIAN AND A GREAT LIAR. \"} [Sâd: 4]. They would send him off and greet him with intense, malevolent looks, and agitated, turbulent emotions: {AND INDEED, THOSE WHO DISBELIEVED WOULD ALMOST SLIP YOU WITH THEIR EYES WHEN THEY HEAR THE REMINDER AND THEY SAY, \"INDEED, HE IS MAD. \"} [Al-Qalam: 51]. And when he sat with the weak among his companions around him, they would mock them and say: {ARE THESE THE ONES UPON WHOM ALLAH HAS GRANTED FAVOR AMONG US?} [Al-An'âm: 53]. Allah the Almighty said: {IS NOT ALLAH MOST KNOWING OF THE THANKFUL?} [Al-An'âm: 53]. And they were, as Allah informed us: {INDEED, THOSE WHO COMMITTED CRIMES USED TO LAUGH AT THOSE WHO BELIEVED. * AND WHENEVER THEY PASSED BY THEM, THEY WOULD WINK AT EACH OTHER [IN MOCKERY]. * AND WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THEIR PEOPLE, THEY WOULD RETURN JESTING. * AND WHEN THEY SAW THEM, THEY WOULD SAY, \"INDEED, THOSE ARE ASTRAY. \" * BUT THEY HAD NOT BEEN SENT AS GUARDIANS OVER THEM.} [Al-Mutaffifîn: 29-33]. * Distortion of his teachings and the raising of doubts, the spread of false propaganda, and the publication of weak arguments about these teachings, as well as about his self and his personality, and the exaggeration of all this so that the general public would have no opportunity to ponder his Message. They said about the Qur'an: {TALES OF THE FORMER PEOPLES WHICH HE HAS WRITTEN DOWN, AND THEY ARE RECITED TO HIM MORNING AND AFTERNOON} [Al-Furqân: 5]. {THIS IS NOT BUT A LIE WHICH HE HAS INVENTED, AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HELPED HIM WITH IT} [Al-Furqân: 4]. And they said: {IT IS ONLY A HUMAN BEING WHO TEACHES HIM} [An-Nahl: 16]. And they said about the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): {WHAT IS THIS MESSENGER THAT EATS FOOD AND WALKS IN THE MARKETS?} [Al-Furqân: 7]. The Qur'an contains many examples of refutations of their arguments, either after quoting them or without quoting them. * Opposing the Qur'an with the tales of the former peoples, and preoccupying the people with them away from it. It is reported that An-Nadr ibn Al-Hârith once said to Quraysh: \"O people of Quraysh, by Allah, a matter has come upon you for which you have not yet found a trick! Muhammad was among you as a young man, the most pleasing to you, the most truthful in speech, the most trustworthy, until you saw gray hair on his temples, and he brought you what he brought you. You said: 'Sorcerer'. No, by Allah, he is not a sorcerer. We have seen sorcerers, their blowing, and their knots. You said: 'Soothsayer'. No, by Allah, he is not a soothsayer. We have seen soothsayers and their convulsions and heard their rhymed prose. You said: 'Poet'. No, by Allah, he is not a poet. We have seen poetry and heard all its descriptions, its *Hazaj* and its *Rajaz*. You said: 'Mad'. No, by Allah, he is not mad. We have seen madness, and he has none of its choking, its whispering, or its confusion. O people of Quraysh, look into your matter, for, by Allah, a great matter has come upon you. \" Then An-Nadr went to Al-Hîrah and learned there the stories of the kings of Persia, the stories of Rustam and Asfandiâr. Thus, when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat in a gathering to remind people of Allah and warn them of His retribution, An-Nadr would follow him and say: \"By Allah, Muhammad does not have better stories than me. \" Then he would tell them stories about the kings of Persia, Rustam, and Asfandiâr, and then say: \"In what way is Muhammad's story better than mine? \" A narration from Ibn 'Abbâs states that An-Nadr had bought singing slave girls (Qaynât). He would not hear of a man inclining toward the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) except that he would send one of them to him to feed him, give him drink, and sing for him so that he would have no inclination left for Islam. Concerning him, the saying of the Almighty was revealed: {AND AMONG THE PEOPLE IS HE WHO BUYS WASTEFUL SPEECH TO MISLEAD [OTHERS] FROM THE WAY OF ALLAH} [Luqmân: 6]. * Negotiations by which they tried to make Islam and the Jâhiliyyah (era of ignorance) meet halfway, by having the polytheists abandon some of what they were upon, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) abandon some of what he was upon: {THEY WISH THAT YOU WOULD COMPROMISE [IN RELIGION] SO THEY WOULD COMPROMISE} [Al-Qalam: 9]. There is a narration reported by Ibn Jarîr and At-Tabarânî indicating that the polytheists proposed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he should worship their deities for one year, and they would worship his Lord for one year. Another narration by 'Abd ibn Humayd indicates that they said: \"If you accepted our deities, we would worship your God. \" Ibn Is-hâq narrated with his chain of transmission, saying: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), while circumambulating the Ka'bah, was confronted by Al-Aswad, Al-Muttalib ibn Asad ibn 'Abd Al-'Uzzâ, Al-Walîd ibn Al-Mughîrah, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, and Al-'Âs ibn Wâ'il As-Sahmî – and they were elderly men among their people – and they said: \"O Muhammad, come! Let us worship what you worship, and you worship what we worship, and we will share the matter, you and us. If what you worship is better than what we worship, we would have taken our share of it. And if what we worship is better than what you worship, you would have taken your share of it. \" Thereupon, Allah the Almighty revealed concerning them: {SAY, \"O YOU DISBELIEVERS, * I DO NOT WORSHIP WHAT YOU WORSHIP}... (the entire Sûrah) [Al-Kâfirûn: 1-2]. Allah resolved their ridiculous negotiation with this decisive separation. Perhaps the difference in the narrations is because they attempted this negotiation repeatedly. * The Persecutions: The polytheists gradually implemented the methods we mentioned to stop the Message after its appearance at the beginning of the fourth year of the Prophethood. Weeks and months passed, and they were limited to these methods, not moving on to the path of persecution and torture. But when they saw that these methods were of no benefit in stopping the Islamic Message, they gathered again and formed a committee of twenty-five men from the leaders of Quraysh, chaired by Abû Lahab, the uncle of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). After consultation and reflection, this committee took a decisive resolution against the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. It decided to spare no effort in fighting Islam, harming His Messenger, torturing those who entered it, and subjecting them to various forms of punishment and pain. They took this resolution and resolved to implement it. As for the Muslims – especially the weak among them – it was very easy. But as for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he was a noble, dignified man with a unique personality that was held in high esteem by the souls of both enemies and friends, so that such a person could only be met with reverence and honor, and only the lowest and most foolish people dared to commit vile and vicious acts against him. Moreover, he was under the protection of Abû Tâlib, and Abû Tâlib was one of the counted men of Makkah, honored in his lineage, honored among the people. No one dared to violate his protection or attack his position. This situation troubled Quraysh, but how long could this prolonged patience last in the face of a Message that sought to eliminate their religious leadership and their worldly prominence? They began the aggressions against the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), with Abû Lahab at the forefront. He had taken this stance against the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from the very first day before Quraysh even contemplated it. We have previously mentioned what he did to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at the gathering of Banû Hâshim and what he did at As-Safâ. It is reported in some narrations that – when he was at As-Safâ – he took a stone to strike the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with it. Abû Lahab had married his two sons, 'Utbah and 'Utaybah, to the two daughters of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthûm, before the Prophethood. When the Prophethood came, he harshly and severely ordered them to divorce them, which they did. When 'Abdullâh – the second son of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – died, Abû Lahab rejoiced and hurried to his companions, announcing to them that Muhammad had become sterile (*Abtar*). We have already mentioned that Abû Lahab would follow the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the Hajj season and in the markets to belie him. Târiq ibn 'Abdillâh Al-Muhâribî reported what indicates that he did not limit himself to denial but would strike him with a stone until his heels bled. Abû Lahab's wife – Umm Jamîl Arwâ bint Harb ibn Umayyah, the sister of Abû Sufyân – was no less hostile to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) than her husband. She would carry thorns and place them on the path of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and at his door at night. She was a foul-mouthed woman who used her tongue against him, prolonged her slander and scheming, fanned the flames of tribulation, and incited a fierce war against the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). That is why the Qur'an described her as the \"Carrier of Wood \" (*Hammâlat Al-Hatab*). When she heard what had been revealed in the Qur'an about her and her husband, she came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) while he was sitting in the Mosque near the Ka'bah, with Abû Bakr As-Siddîq. In her hand, she held a *Fahr*, which is a handful of stones. When she stood before them, Allah took away her sight of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so she only saw Abû Bakr. She said: \"O Abû Bakr, where is your companion? I have heard that he has satirized me. By Allah, if I find him, I will strike his mouth with this stone. By Allah, I am a poetess too. \" Then she said: \"To Mudhammam (*the blamed one*), we disobeyed, And his command we rejected, And his religion we hated. \" Then she left. Abû Bakr said: \"O Messenger of Allah, did you not see that she saw you? \" He replied: \"She did not see me. Allah took away her sight of me. \" Abû Bakr Al-Bazzâr narrated this story. In it, when she stood before Abû Bakr, she said: \"Abû Bakr, your companion has satirized us. \" Abû Bakr said: \"No, by the Lord of this structure (the Ka'bah), he neither speaks poetry nor pronounces it. \" She said: \"You are truthful. \" Abû Lahab did all this while he was the uncle and neighbor of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), his house was adjacent to his. Likewise, others of the Messenger of Allah's neighbors would harm him while he was in his house. Ibn Is-hâq said: The individuals who harmed the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in his house were Abû Lahab, Al-Hakam ibn Abî Al-'Âs ibn Umayyah, 'Uqbah ibn Abî Mu'ayt, 'Adî ibn Hamrâ' Ath-Thaqafî, and Ibn Al-Asdâ' Al-Hudhali – and they were his neighbors. None of them embraced Islam except Al-Hakam ibn Abî Al-'Âs. One of them would throw a stone at him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to hide from them when he prayed. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was afflicted with that harm, he would carry it out on a stick, stand by his door and say: \"O Banû 'Abd Manâf, what kind of neighborliness is this? \" Then he would throw it in the street. 'Uqbah ibn Abî Mu'ayt increased his wickedness and malice. Al-Bukhârî narrated on the authority of 'Abdullâh ibn Mas'ûd (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was praying near the Ka'bah, and Abû Jahl and some of his companions were sitting. Some of them said to others: \"Which of you will bring the filth of the slaughtered camel of Banû so-and-so and place it on Muhammad's back when he prostrates? \" The most wretched among the people ('Uqbah ibn Abî Mu'ayt) stood up, brought it, and waited. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prostrated, he placed it on his back between his shoulders. I was watching, unable to do anything, if only I had power to defend myself. They began to laugh and lean on each other (in joy and arrogance), while the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was in prostration, not raising his head until Fâtima came, threw it off his back, and he raised his head. Then he said: \"O Allah, I entrust Quraysh to You, \" (three times). That distressed them when he prayed against them, for they believed that the supplication in that land was answered. Then he named: \"O Allah, I entrust Abû Jahl to You, and 'Utbah ibn Rabî'ah, Shaybah ibn Rabî'ah, Al-Walîd ibn 'Utbah, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, and 'Uqbah ibn Abî Mu'ayt! \" – He named a seventh person, but he did not remember him. – \"By the One in whose hand is my soul, I saw those whom the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) named, dead in the pit, the pit of Badr. \" Umayyah ibn Khalaf, when he saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), would mock and backbite him. Concerning him, the verse was revealed: {WOE TO EVERY SLANDERER AND BACKBITER} [Al-Humazah: 1]. Ibn Hishâm said: The *Humazah* (slanderer) is one who openly insults a man, glares at him, and mocks him. The *Lumazah* (backbiter) is one who secretly blames and harms people. As for his brother Ubayy ibn Khalaf, he and 'Uqbah ibn Abî Mu'ayt were close friends. 'Uqbah once sat with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and listened to him. When this reached Ubayy, he admonished him, rebuked him, and asked him to spit in the face of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which he did. Ubayy ibn Khalaf himself crumbled a rotten bone and then blew it in the wind toward the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Al-Akhnas ibn Sharîq Ath-Thaqafî was among those who attacked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Qur'an described him with nine attributes that indicate what he was upon, in the saying of the Almighty: {AND DO NOT OBEY EVERY HABITUAL SWEARER [WHO IS] CONTEMPTIBLE, * A BACKBITER, GOING ABOUT WITH SLANDER, * A PREVENTER OF GOOD, AGGRESSIVE, SINFUL, * CRUEL, AND AFTER THAT, BASEBORN} [Al-Qalam: 10-13]. Abû Jahl would sometimes come to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to hear the Qur'an, then leave without believing, obeying, behaving properly, or fearing (Allah). He would harm the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with words, hinder people from the path of Allah, and then leave, strutting proudly at what he had done, boasting of the evil he had committed, as if he had done something noteworthy. Concerning him, the verse was revealed: {SO HE NEITHER BELIEVED NOR PRAYED}... etc. He would prevent the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from praying from the first day he saw him praying in the Sanctuary. Once, he passed by him while he was praying near the station (Maqâm) and said: \"O Muhammad, did I not forbid you from this? \" He threatened him, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spoke harshly to him and rebuked him. He said: \"O Muhammad, with what are you threatening me? By Allah, I have the largest assembly (Nâdî) in this valley! \" Then the verse was revealed: {THEN LET HIM CALL HIS ASSEMBLY} [Al-'Alaq: 17]. In one narration, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) grabbed him by the neck and shook him, saying: {WOE TO YOU, AND WOE! * THEN WOE TO YOU, AND WOE!} [Al-Qiyâmah: 34-35]. The enemy of Allah said: \"Are you threatening me, O Muhammad? By Allah, neither you nor your Lord can do anything. I am the most honored of those who walk between its two mountains. \" Abû Jahl did not recover from his stupidity after this rebuke, but rather became even more wretched afterward. Muslim reported on the authority of Abû Hurayra: Abû Jahl said: \"Does Muhammad rub his face in the dust among you? \" It was said: \"Yes. \" He said: \"By Al-Lât and Al-'Uzzâ, if I see him, I will step on his neck and rub his face in the dust. \" He came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) while he was praying, intending to step on his neck. They were suddenly surprised to see him retreating on his heels, protecting himself with his hands. They said: \"What is wrong with you, O Abâ Al-Hakam? \" He said: \"Indeed, there is a trench of fire and wings between him and me! \" The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"If he had come close to me, the angels would have snatched him limb by limb. \" These aggressions against the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), despite the dignity and majesty of his unique personality in the hearts of the common and elite, and despite the protection of Abû Tâlib, the most respected man in Makkah, were serious. But as for the Muslims – especially the weak among them – the measures were harsher and more bitter. At the same time, every tribe began to torture in various ways those of its members who embraced Islam, and those who had no tribe were subjected to various forms of oppression by the rabble and the leaders, the mere mention of which frightens the heart of the patient man. Abû Jahl, if he heard that a man of high status and protection had embraced Islam, would reprimand him, disgrace him, and threaten him with huge losses in wealth and status. If he was weak, he would beat him and incite others against him. The uncle of 'Uthmân ibn 'Affân would wrap him in a mat of palm leaves and then smoke him from underneath. When Mus'ab ibn 'Umayr's mother learned of his Islam, she starved him and expelled him from her house. He had lived the most luxurious life, and his skin began to peel like a snake's. Bilâl was the slave of Umayyah ibn Khalaf Al-Jumahî. Umayyah would put a rope around his neck, then hand him over to the boys who would drag him through the hills of Makkah until the mark of the rope was visible on his neck. Umayyah would tie him tightly, then beat him with a stick. He would force him to sit in the intense heat of the sun, and he would also compel him to starve. Worse than all that, he would take him out when the midday heat was intense, throw him on the scorching sand of Makkah, and then order a huge rock to be placed on his chest, saying: \"By Allah, you will remain like this until you die or disbelieve in Muhammad and worship Al-Lât and Al-'Uzzâ. \" And Bilâl, in that state, would say: \"One, One (Ahad, Ahad)! \" One day, Abû Bakr passed by and saw them doing this to him. He bought him for a black slave, or, according to another version, for seven or five ounces of silver, and freed him. 'Ammâr ibn Yâsir (may Allah be pleased with him) was a client of Banû Makhzûm. He, his father, and his mother embraced Islam. The polytheists – with Abû Jahl at their head – would take them out to the open area (Al-Abtah) when the sand was scorching hot and torture them with its heat. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by them while they were being tortured and said: \"Patience, O family of Yâsir, for your appointed destination is Paradise! \" Yâsir died under the torture, and Abû Jahl stabbed Sumayyah – 'Ammâr's mother – in her private part with a spear, and she died. She was the first martyr in Islam. They intensified the torture against 'Ammâr, sometimes with heat, other times by placing a hot red stone on his chest, and other times by drowning. They said: \"We will not leave you until you insult Muhammad or speak well of Al-Lât and Al-'Uzzâ. \" He agreed to this under duress and came weeping, apologizing to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Then Allah revealed: {WHOEVER DISBELIEVES IN ALLAH AFTER HIS BELIEF – EXCEPT FOR ONE WHO IS COMPELLED [TO DO SO] WHILE HIS HEART IS FIRM WITH FAITH} [An-Nahl: 106]. Abû Fukayhah – whose name was Aflah – was a slave of Banû 'Abd Ad-Dâr. They would tie a rope to his leg and drag him on the ground. Khabbâb ibn Al-Aratt was a slave of Umm Anmâr bint Sibâ' Al-Khuzâ'iyyah. The polytheists would make him taste various forms of torture. They would grab his hair and pull it, violently twisting his neck. They repeatedly laid him down on burning charcoal, then placed a rock on him so that he could not get up. Zunairah, An-Nahdiyyah and her daughter, and Umm 'Ubayse were slave women who had embraced Islam. The polytheists subjected them to tortures similar to those mentioned. A slave girl of Banû Mu'ammal – a clan of Banû 'Adî – converted. 'Umar ibn Al-Khattâb – who was a polytheist at the time – would beat her, until, tired, he would say: \"I only left you out of weariness. \" Abû Bakr bought these slave girls and freed them, just as he freed Bilâl and 'Âmir ibn Fuhayrah. The polytheists would wrap some of the Companions in the hides of camels and cows, then throw them into the heat of the scorching sand. They would clothe others in iron coats of mail, then throw them onto a burning rock. The list of those tortured for the sake of Allah is long and very painful. There was no one whose conversion they learned of except that they confronted him and harmed him. * Dâr Al-Arqam: In the face of these persecutions, it was wise for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to prevent the Muslims from declaring their Islam in word or deed and to meet with them only in secret. If he were to meet with them openly, there is no doubt that the polytheists would prevent him from purifying the Muslims and teaching them the Book and the Wisdom, and this might lead to a clash between the two parties. This actually happened in the fourth year of the Prophethood. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to gather in the ravines and pray there secretly. A group of Quraysh disbelievers saw them, insulted them, and fought them. Sa'd ibn Abî Waqqâs struck a man, and his blood flowed. This was the first blood shed in Islam. It is known that if the clash had multiplied and prolonged, it would have led to the destruction and annihilation of the Muslims. Therefore, it was wise to go into hiding. The majority of the Companions concealed their Islam, their worship, their call, and their gatherings. As for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he openly proclaimed the Message and worship in the midst of the polytheists, with nothing diverting him from that, but he met with the Muslims in secret for their benefit and the benefit of Islam. Dâr Al-Arqam ibn Abî Al-Arqam Al-Makhzûmî was on As-Safâ. It was away from the eyes and gatherings of the tyrants. He made it a center for his Message and for his meetings with the Muslims from the fifth year of the Prophethood. * The First Hijra to Abyssinia: The persecutions began in the middle or late fourth year of the Prophethood. They started weakly and then continued to intensify day by day and month by month until they became severe and critical in the middle of the fifth year, to the extent that remaining in Makkah became unbearable for them, and this compelled them to think of a trick to save them from this painful torment. In this dark, difficult hour, Sûrat Al-Kahf was revealed in response to questions posed by the polytheists to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). But it contained three stories with eloquent allusions from Allah the Almighty to His believing servants. The story of the Companions of the Cave (*Ashâb Al-Kahf*) guides one to emigrate from the centers of disbelief and aggression when fearing temptation for one's religion, relying on Allah: {AND WHEN YOU HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THEM AND THAT WHICH THEY WORSHIP EXCEPT ALLAH, SHELTER THEREFORE IN THE CAVE; YOUR LORD WILL SPREAD FOR YOU OF HIS MERCY AND WILL PREPARE FOR YOU FROM YOUR AFFAIR AMENITY} [Al-Kahf: 16]. The story of Al-Khidr and Moses indicates that circumstances do not always unfold or yield results according to their apparent nature. Rather, the matter might be completely the opposite of the apparent. There is a subtle allusion here that the war waged against the Muslims will completely reverse, and these polytheist tyrants – if they do not believe – will be defeated by these weak, repressed Muslims. The story of Dhû Al-Qarnayn indicates that the earth belongs to Allah, and He inherits it to whomever He wills of His servants. And that success is only found on the path of Faith, not disbelief, and that Allah continues to send among His servants – from time to time – one who will save the weak from the Gog and Magog of that time. And that the most deserving of inheriting the earth are the righteous servants of Allah. Then Sûrat Az-Zumar was revealed, alluding to the emigration, and declaring that the earth of Allah is not narrow: {FOR THOSE WHO HAVE DONE GOOD IN THIS WORLD IS GOOD, AND THE EARTH OF ALLAH IS VAST. INDEED, THE PATIENT WILL BE GIVEN THEIR REWARD WITHOUT ACCOUNT} [Az-Zumar: 10]. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) knew that Ashama An-Najâshî, the king of Abyssinia, was a just king, with whom no one was oppressed. So, he commanded the Muslims to emigrate to Abyssinia to flee the tribulations for their religion. In Rajab of the fifth year of the Prophethood, the first group of Companions emigrated to Abyssinia. It consisted of twelve men and four women, led by 'Uthmân ibn 'Affân, accompanied by Sayyidah Ruqayyah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said about them that they were the first household to emigrate for the cause of Allah after Abraham and Lot (peace be upon them). The departure of these individuals was stealthy in the darkness of the night – so that Quraysh would not notice them. They headed to the sea, aiming for the port of Shu'aybah. Destiny provided them with two merchant ships that sailed them to Abyssinia. Quraysh noticed and went out in pursuit of them, but by the time they reached the shore, the Muslims had departed safely, and they settled in Abyssinia, enjoying the best neighborly protection. In Ramadân of the same year, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to the Sanctuary, where there was a large gathering of Quraysh, including their leaders and notables. He stood up among them and suddenly began reciting Sûrat An-Najm. Those disbelievers had not heard the Word of Allah before, because their constant method was to act upon what they had mutually advised each other, by saying: {DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS QUR'AN AND DISTURB [IT] THAT YOU MAY OVERCOME} [Fussilat: 26]. When he surprised them with the recitation of this Sûrah, and magnificent, captivating Divine Words – whose splendor and majesty defy description – struck their ears, they forgot what they were doing, and everyone remained listening to him, thinking of nothing else. Until, at the end of this Sûrah, he recited verses that make hearts fly, and then read: {SO PROSTRATE TO ALLAH AND WORSHIP [HIM]} [An-Najm: 62], and then he prostrated. No one could restrain himself from falling into prostration. In reality, the grandeur of the Truth had cracked the stubbornness in the souls of the arrogant and the mockers, and they could not help but fall in prostration to Allah. They were dismayed when they realized that the majesty of Allah's Word had restrained them, and they had committed the very thing they were striving to erase and eliminate. Reproach and blame poured upon them from all sides, from those polytheists who had not witnessed this scene. At that, they lied about the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and claimed that he had spoken favorably of their idols, saying about them: \"Those are the exalted goddesses (*Al-Gharânîq Al-'Ulâ*), and their intercession is hoped for. \" They brought this manifest falsehood to excuse their prostration with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and this is not surprising from a people who concocted lies and prolonged scheming and slander. This news reached the emigrants in Abyssinia, but in a form completely different from its reality. They were informed that Quraysh had embraced Islam. So, they returned to Makkah in Shawwâl of the same year. When they were an hour's journey from Makkah, in broad daylight, and learned the truth of the matter, some of them returned to Abyssinia. None of the rest entered Makkah except secretly or under the protection of a man from Quraysh. Then the affliction and torment from Quraysh intensified against them and against the Muslims, and their tribes fiercely attacked them. The news of the Negus's good protection was hard for Quraysh to bear. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw no alternative but to suggest to his Companions to emigrate to Abyssinia once more. This Second Hijra was more difficult than the first, as Quraysh had become vigilant and resolved to thwart it. However, the Muslims were faster, and Allah facilitated their travel. They reached the Negus of Abyssinia before they could be overtaken. This time, eighty-three men emigrated – there is doubt about 'Ammâr being among them – and eighteen or nineteen women. The scholar Muhammad Sulaymân Al-Mansûrfûrî affirmed the former number. * Quraysh's Plot Against the Abyssinian Emigrants: It was unbearable for the polytheists that the emigrants found refuge for themselves and their religion. They chose two strong and intelligent men, 'Amr ibn Al-'Âs and 'Abdullâh ibn Abî Rabî'ah – before they embraced Islam – and sent with them rare gifts for the Negus and his patriarchs. After the two men delivered these gifts to the patriarchs and provided them with arguments by which those Muslims would be expelled, and after the patriarchs agreed to advise the Negus to send them away, they presented themselves to the Negus, offered him the gifts, and spoke to him. They said to him: \"O King, some foolish youths have sought refuge in your country. They have abandoned the religion of their people, have not entered your religion, and have brought a religion they invented, which neither we nor you know. The nobles of their people, their fathers, their uncles, and their clans, have sent us to you concerning them, so that you may return them to them, as they know them better and are more aware of what they find fault with and blame them for. \" The patriarchs said: \"They have spoken the truth, O King. Hand them over to them, so that they may return them to their people and their land. \" But the Negus saw that it was necessary to investigate the matter and hear all sides. He sent for the Muslims and summoned them. They came, and they were resolved to speak the truth, whatever the outcome. The Negus asked them: \"What is this religion for which you have separated from your people, and which you have not entered into my religion or the religion of any of these faiths? \" Ja'far ibn Abî Tâlib – who was the spokesman for the Muslims – said: \"O King, we were a people of the Jâhiliyyah (ignorance), we worshipped idols, ate carrion, committed indecencies, cut off kinship ties, and were bad neighbors. The strong among us consumed the weak. We were upon that until Allah sent to us a Messenger from among ourselves, whose lineage, truthfulness, trustworthiness, and chastity we know. He called us to Allah to unify Him and worship Him, and to cast off what we and our fathers used to worship besides Him, of stones and idols. He commanded us to be truthful in speech, to render trusts, to maintain kinship ties, to be good neighbors, and to restrain from unlawful things and bloodshed. He forbade us from indecencies, false testimony, consuming the wealth of the orphan, and slandering chaste women. He commanded us to worship Allah Alone, associating nothing with Him. He commanded us to [observe] prayer, *Zakât*, and fasting. \" – He enumerated the matters of Islam to him. – \"So, we believed in him, had faith in him, and followed him in what he brought us from the religion of Allah. We worshipped Allah Alone, associating nothing with Him. We forbade what He forbade us and permitted what He permitted us. Our people attacked us, tortured us, and tempted us away from our religion to return us to the worship of idols instead of the worship of Allah the Almighty, and to consider permissible the evil things we used to consider permissible. When they conquered us, oppressed us, constrained us, and came between us and our religion, we came out to your country, chose you over others, desired your protection, and hoped not to be oppressed with you, O King. \" The Negus asked him: \"Do you have anything with you of what he brought from Allah? \" Ja'far said: \"Yes! \" The Negus said to him: \"Then read it to me. \" He recited to him the beginning of {KÂF HÂ YÂ 'AYN SÂD} [Maryam: 1]. By Allah, the Negus wept until his beard was soaked, and his patriarchs wept until their Scriptures were soaked when they heard what he recited to them. Then the Negus said to them: \"This and what Jesus brought come from the same niche (source). \" He said to 'Amr ibn Al-'Âs and his companion: \"Go! By Allah, I will never hand them over to you, nor will they be harmed. \" – Addressing 'Amr ibn Al-'Âs and his companion. – They left. 'Amr ibn Al-'Âs said to 'Abdullâh ibn Rabî'ah: \"By Allah, I will come back to them tomorrow with something about them that will utterly eradicate them. \" 'Abdullâh ibn Rabî'ah said to him: \"Do not do that, for they have kinship ties, even if they have opposed us. \" But 'Amr insisted on his opinion. The next day, he said to the Negus: \"O King, they say a grave thing about Jesus, son of Mary. \" The Negus sent for them to ask them about their saying concerning the Christ. They were frightened but resolved to speak the truth, whatever the outcome. When they entered upon him and he asked them, Ja'far said to him: \"We say about him what our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought us: He is the servant of Allah, His Messenger, His Spirit, and His Word which He cast upon Mary, the Pure Virgin. \" The Negus took a stick from the ground and then said: \"By Allah, Jesus, son of Mary, did not exceed what you said by the length of this stick. \" His patriarchs grumbled. He said: \"Even if you grumble, by Allah! \" Then he said to the Muslims: \"Go, for you are safe (*Shuyûm*) in my land. \" – *Ash-Shuyûm* means \"the safe ones \" in the Abyssinian language. – \"Whoever insults you will be fined, whoever insults you will be fined, whoever insults you will be fined. I would not love to have a mountain (*Dibr*) of gold and harm one of you. \" – *Ad-Dibr* means \"the mountain \" in the Abyssinian language. Then he said to his entourage: \"Return their gifts to them, for I have no need of them. By Allah, Allah did not take a bribe from me when He restored my kingdom to me, so should I accept a bribe concerning it? And I did not obey the people in it, so should I obey them now? \" Umm Salamah, who narrates this story, said: They departed from him disgraced and with their gifts returned to them, and we remained with him in the best abode with the best neighbor. This is the narration of Ibn Is-hâq. Others mentioned that 'Amr ibn Al-'Âs's delegation to the Negus occurred after Badr. Some combined the two by saying that there were two delegations, but the questions and answers reported to have taken place between the Negus and Ja'far in the second delegation are almost the same as those mentioned by Ibn Is-hâq. Furthermore, the content of those questions indicates that they occurred during the first presentation to the Negus. The polytheists' trick failed, and their plot was foiled. They realized that they could only manifest their malice within the limits of their authority. Because of this, a terrifying idea arose among them. They concluded that escaping this \"calamity \" was impossible without the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) completely stopping his Message, or without executing him. But how could they achieve this when Abû Tâlib protected him and stood between them and him? They decided to confront Abû Tâlib on this matter. * Quraysh Threatens Abû Tâlib: The leaders of Quraysh came to Abû Tâlib and said to him: \"O Abû Tâlib, you have age, nobility, and status among us. We asked you to restrain your nephew, but you did not. By Allah, we will not tolerate this anymore, his insulting our fathers, mocking our intellect, and finding fault with our deities. Either restrain him from us, or we will fight you and him over this until one of the two parties perishes. \" This threat and severe warning weighed heavily on Abû Tâlib. He sent for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said to him: \"O my nephew, your people have come to me and said such and such. Have mercy on me and on yourself, and do not burden me with a matter I cannot bear. \" The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) thought that his uncle was abandoning him and that he was too weak to support him. He said: \"O uncle, by Allah, if they were to place the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left hand on the condition that I abandon this matter – until Allah makes it victorious or I perish pursuing it – I would never abandon it! \" Then he sobbed and wept, and got up. When he turned to leave, Abû Tâlib called out to him. When he turned back, he said to him: \"Go, my nephew, say what you like. By Allah, I will never hand you over for anything. \" And he recited: \"By Allah, they shall never reach you with their gathering, Until I am laid, buried in the dust. So proclaim your command; there is no blame on you, And rejoice, and refresh your eyes with that. \" * Quraysh Before Abû Tâlib Once More: When Quraysh saw that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was proceeding with his work, they knew that Abû Tâlib refused to abandon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and that he was resolved to separate from them and be hostile to them in this matter. They went to him with 'Umârah ibn Al-Walîd ibn Al-Mughîrah and said to him: \"O Abû Tâlib, this young man is the most vigorous and handsome youth in Quraysh. Take him, and you will have his intellect and support. Adopt him as a son, he is yours. And hand over to us your nephew, this one who has opposed your religion and the religion of your fathers, divided the unity of your people, and mocked their intellect, so that we may kill him. It is one man for one man. \" He said: \"By Allah, what an evil thing you propose to me! You give me your son for me to feed him for you, and I give you my son for you to kill him? By Allah, this will never happen! \" Al-Mut'im ibn 'Adî ibn Nawfal ibn 'Abd Manâf said: \"By Allah, O Abû Tâlib, your people have been just to you and have strived to resolve what he has caused. I do not see that you wish to accept anything from them. \" He said: \"By Allah, you have not been just to me. But you are resolved to forsake me and ally yourselves with the people against me. So, do what you think best. \" Historical sources do not mention the time of these two delegations, but it seems, after examining the clues and evidence, that they occurred in the middle of the sixth year of the Prophethood, and that the interval between the two delegations was short. * The Tyrants' Idea to Execute the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): After the failure and disappointment of Quraysh in the two delegations, they returned to their ferocity and torment, more intense than before. During these days, the idea of executing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in another way arose among their tyrants. This idea and that ferocity were what led to the strengthening of Islam by two noble heroes of Makkah: Hamzah ibn 'Abd Al-Muttalib and 'Umar ibn Al-Khattâb (may Allah be pleased with them). Among that ferocity, it is reported that 'Utaybah ibn Abî Lahab came one day to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: \"I disbelieve in {By the star when it descends} [An-Najm: 1] and in {The one who approached and descended} [An-Najm: 8]. \" Then he attacked him with harm, tore his shirt, and spat in the face of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but the spittle did not reach him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then prayed against him and said: \"O Allah, set a dog from among Your dogs upon him. \" His prayer (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was answered. 'Utaybah went out one day with a group of Quraysh until they stopped at a place in Syria called Az-Zarqâ'. A lion circled them that night. 'Utaybah began to say: \"Woe to my brother! By Allah, it is the one that will devour me, as Muhammad prayed against me! He killed me while he is in Makkah, and I am in Syria! \" The lion lunged at him from among the people, seized his head, and slaughtered him. Also among that is the mention that 'Uqbah ibn Abî Mu'ayt stepped on his noble neck while he was in prostration, so much so that his eyes almost bulged out. What indicates that their tyrants wanted to kill him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is what Ibn Is-hâq reported in a long Hadith, saying: Abû Jahl said: \"O people of Quraysh, Muhammad has refused everything except what you see: finding fault with our religion, insulting our fathers, mocking our intellect, and insulting our deities. I swear by Allah that I will sit for him with a stone that I can barely lift. If he prostrates in his prayer, I will smash his head with it. Hand me over then, or protect me. Let the Banû 'Abd Manâf do what they want after that. \" They said: \"By Allah, we will never hand you over for anything. Proceed with what you want. \" When morning came, Abû Jahl took a stone as he had described, and then sat for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), waiting for him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out as he usually did and began to pray. Quraysh had also gone out and sat in their assemblies, waiting to see what Abû Jahl would do. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prostrated, Abû Jahl lifted the stone and approached him. When he got close to him, he retreated, defeated, his color changed, having not carried out his intention. Ibn Ishaq said: It was mentioned to me that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “That is Gabriel (peace be upon him). If he had drawn closer, he would have seized him.” After that, Abu Jahl did to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) what led to the conversion of Hamza (may Allah be pleased with him), as will be related later. As for the tyrants of Quraysh, the idea of execution continued to mature in their hearts. Ibn Ishaq narrated on the authority of Abd Allah ibn Amr ibn al-As, who said: I was present when they gathered in the Hijr (the Kaaba enclosure). They mentioned the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and they said: “We have not seen anything like what we have endured from this man's affair. We have shown great patience regarding him.” While they were like that, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appeared. He walked until he kissed the Corner (of the Kaaba), then passed them while circumambulating the House (the Kaaba). They insulted him with some words, and I saw the effect of that on the face of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When he passed them the second time, they insulted him with the like, and I saw the effect on his face. Then, he passed them the third time, and they insulted him with the like. He stopped and said: “Are you listening, O people of Quraysh? By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I have brought you slaughter!” His words struck the people, so much so that there was no man among them who did not feel as if a bird was sitting upon his head. Even the most hostile among them softened and spoke to him with the best words they could find, saying: “Leave, O Abul-Qasim! By Allah, you were never ignorant.” The next day, they gathered again, discussing his affair, when he appeared to them. They leaped at him as one man and surrounded him. I saw one man take hold of the gathering of his cloak. Abu Bakr stood up for him, weeping and saying: “Would you kill a man because he says, 'My Lord is Allah'?” Then they dispersed from him. Ibn Amr said: That was the worst thing I ever saw Quraysh inflict upon him. End of summary. In a narration by Al-Bukhari on the authority of Urwah ibn Az-Zubayr, he said: I asked Ibn Amr ibn al-As, “Tell me about the severest thing the polytheists did to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” He said: While the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was praying in the Hijr of the Kaaba, Uqbah ibn Abi Mu'ayt came forward, put his garment around the Prophet's neck, and strangled him severely. Abu Bakr came forward, took hold of his shoulders, pushed him away from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and said: “Would you kill a man because he says, 'My Lord is Allah'?” In the Hadith of Asma, she said: A cry of alarm came to Abu Bakr, saying: “Go to your companion!” He left our house, wearing his four braids, and he went out saying: “Would you kill a man because he says, 'My Lord is Allah'?” They neglected the Prophet and turned their attention to Abu Bakr. He returned to us, and we could not touch anything of his braids without them coming loose. The Conversion of Hamza (may Allah be pleased with him) : In this atmosphere overcast with the clouds of oppression and tyranny, a flash of light illuminated the path for the oppressed, which was the conversion of Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib (may Allah be pleased with him). He embraced Islam in the latter part of the sixth year of the Prophethood, and it is most probable that he embraced Islam in the month of Dhu al-Hijjah. The reason for his conversion was that one day, Abu Jahl passed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) near As-Safa, harmed him, and reviled him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent, not speaking to him. Then, Abu Jahl struck him on the head with a stone, wounding him until blood flowed, and then he left him for the Quraysh gathering place near the Kaaba and sat with them. A female slave belonging to Abd Allah ibn Jud'an, whose dwelling was on As-Safa, witnessed this. Hamza returned from hunting, carrying his bow, and the slave informed him of what she had seen Abu Jahl do. Hamza became enraged – he was the most honoured and most resolute young man among Quraysh – and rushed out. He stopped for no one, intent on inflicting harm upon Abu Jahl when he met him. When he entered the Mosque, he stood over Abu Jahl and said to him: “O you who makes his buttocks yellow! Do you insult my nephew when I follow his religion?” Then, he struck him with his bow, inflicting a nasty wound. Men from Banu Makhzum – Abu Jahl's tribe – leaped up, and the Banu Hashim – Hamza's tribe – leaped up. Abu Jahl said: “Leave Abu Umara alone, for I did indeed revile his nephew with a terrible insult.” Hamza's conversion was initially the pride of a man who refused to see his ally humiliated. Then, Allah opened his heart, and he held fast to the firmest handhold. The Muslims gained immense pride from him. The Conversion of Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) : Within this atmosphere overcast with the clouds of oppression and tyranny, another flash of light appeared, even brighter and more illuminating than the first: the conversion of Umar ibn al-Khattab. He embraced Islam in Dhu al-Hijjah of the sixth year of the Prophethood, three days after Hamza's conversion (may Allah be pleased with him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had prayed to Allah for his conversion. Al-Tirmidhi narrated from Ibn Umar, and authenticated it, and Al-Tabarani narrated from Ibn Mas'ud and Anas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O Allah, strengthen Islam with the one of the two men You love more: Umar ibn al-Khattab or Abu Jahl ibn Hisham.” The one more beloved to Allah was Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). After reviewing all the narrations regarding his conversion, it appears that the entrance of Islam into his heart was gradual. However, before presenting their summary, we should point out the emotions and feelings that he possessed (may Allah be pleased with him). He (may Allah be pleased with him) was known for his sharp temper and strong resolve. Muslims had suffered various forms of harm from him many times. It appears that conflicting emotions were struggling within him: his respect for the traditions established by his fathers and grandfathers, his indulgence in the pleasures of drinking and amusement he was accustomed to, then his admiration for the steadfastness of the Muslims and their endurance of tribulation for the sake of their belief, and finally, the doubts that assailed him – like any sensible person – that what Islam called for might be nobler and purer than anything else. Therefore, whenever he flared up, he would eventually tire out. The summary of the narrations, combining them, regarding his conversion (may Allah be pleased with him) is that one night he decided to sleep outside his house. He came to the Sanctuary and entered behind the curtain of the Kaaba. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was standing in prayer and had begun reciting Surah *Al-Haqqah* (The Reality). Umar began to listen to the Quran and was amazed by its composition. He said: “I said to myself: By Allah, he is a poet, as Quraysh claimed.” He recited: {Indeed, it is the word of a noble Messenger. And it is not the word of a poet; little do you believe.} [Al-Haqqah: 40-41]. He said: “I said: A soothsayer.” He recited: {Nor is it the word of a soothsayer; little do you remember. [It is] a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.} [Al-Haqqah: 42-43] until the end of the Surah. He said: “Then Islam fell into my heart.” This was the first planting of the seed of Islam in his heart. However, the outer layer of *Jahiliyyah* (pre-Islamic ignorance) inclinations, traditional tribal partisanship, and pride in the religion of the ancestors predominated over the core truth that his heart was whispering. So, he remained zealous in his actions against Islam, heedless of the feeling lurking behind this layer. Because of his sharp temper and excessive enmity towards the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he went out one day, wearing his sword, intending to eliminate the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He was met by Nu'aym ibn Abd Allah An-Nahham Al-'Adawi, or a man from Banu Zuhrah, or a man from Banu Makhzum, who asked: “Where are you heading, O Umar?” He replied: “I want to kill Muhammad.” The man said: “How will you be safe from Banu Hashim and Banu Zuhrah after killing Muhammad?” Umar said to him: “I only see you as having apostatized and abandoned your religion.” The man replied: “Should I not tell you of something amazing, O Umar? Your sister and your brother-in-law have indeed apostatized and abandoned your religion.” Umar walked in a rage until he reached them. Khabbab ibn al-Aratt was with them, holding a parchment containing {Ta-Ha} and reciting it to them – he used to visit them and teach them the Quran. When Khabbab heard Umar's footsteps, he hid inside the house, and Fatima – Umar's sister – concealed the parchment. Umar had heard Khabbab's recitation to them when he approached the house. When he entered, he asked: “What is this murmuring I heard coming from you?” They replied: “It was just a conversation we were having amongst ourselves.” He said: “Perhaps you two have apostatized!” His brother-in-law said to him: “O Umar, what if the truth lies in a religion other than yours?” Umar leaped upon his brother-in-law and trod on him severely. His sister came to lift him off her husband, and Umar struck her a blow with his hand, bloodying her face – in Ibn Ishaq's narration, he struck and wounded her. She said, angrily: “O Umar, if the truth lies in a religion other than yours, I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah!” When Umar gave up, and saw the blood on his sister, he regretted and was ashamed. He said: “Give me this book you have so I may read it.” His sister replied: “You are unclean, and none but the purified may touch it. Stand up and wash yourself (perform a ritual bath).” He stood up and washed himself. Then he took the book and read {In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful}. He said: “Good and pure Names.” Then he read {Ta-Ha} until he reached His saying: {Indeed, I am Allah. There is no god besides Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance.} [Ta-Ha: 14]. He said: “How beautiful and noble are these words! Guide me to Muhammad.” When Khabbab heard Umar's words, he came out of the house and said: “Rejoice, O Umar! I hope that you are the one for whom the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed on Thursday night (O Allah, strengthen Islam with Umar ibn al-Khattab or with Abu Jahl ibn Hisham).” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was in the house at the foot of As-Safa. Umar took his sword and strapped it on. Then he set out until he reached the house. He knocked on the door. A man stood looking through the crack of the door and saw him with his sword strapped on. He informed the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The people gathered. Hamza asked them: “What is the matter with you?” They said: “Umar.” Hamza said: “And what about Umar? Open the door for him. If he has come desiring good, we will bestow it upon him; and if he has come desiring evil, we will kill him with his own sword.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was inside, receiving revelation. He came out to Umar and met him in the courtyard. He took hold of the edges of his cloak and the straps of his sword, then pulled him with a jerk and said: “Will you not desist, O Umar, until Allah sends down upon you the disgrace and punishment that He sent down upon Al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah? O Allah, this is Umar ibn al-Khattab. O Allah, strengthen Islam with Umar ibn al-Khattab.” Then Umar said: “I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that you are the Messenger of Allah.” He embraced Islam, and the people of the house pronounced a *Takbir* (Allah is Greater) that the people of the Mosque heard. Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was a man of indomitable resolve. His conversion created an uproar among the polytheists, filled with humiliation and disgrace, and clothed the Muslims with pride, honour, and joy. Ibn Ishaq narrated with his chain of transmission from Umar, who said: “When I embraced Islam, I remembered who among the people of Mecca was the most hostile to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” He said: “I thought: Abu Jahl. So, I went and knocked on his door. He came out to me and said: 'Welcome. What brings you?' I said: 'I came to inform you that I have believed in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, and I have believed in what he has brought.'” He said: “He slammed the door in my face and said: 'May Allah curse you, and curse what you have brought.'” Ibn al-Jawzi mentioned that Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When a man embraced Islam, other men would cling to him, striking him, and he would strike them.” He said: “When I embraced Islam, I went to my maternal uncle, Al-As ibn Hashim, and informed him, but he went back into his house.” He said: “I also went to a man from the leaders of Quraysh, perhaps Abu Jahl, and informed him, and he went back into his house.” Ibn Hisham, and likewise Ibn al-Jawzi in a summarized form, mentioned that when he embraced Islam, he went to Jamil ibn Ma'mar Al-Jumahi – who was the quickest of Quraysh to spread news – and informed him that he had embraced Islam. Jamil shouted at the top of his voice that Ibn al-Khattab had apostatized. Umar – who was behind him – said: “He lies, I have only embraced Islam.” They rushed upon him, and he kept fighting them, and they fighting him, until the sun stood over their heads. Umar became exhausted and sat down. They stood over his head, and he said: “Do whatever you want! I swear by Allah that if we were three hundred men, we would have left it to you, or you would have left it to us.” After that, the polytheists marched to his house, intending to kill him. Al-Bukhari narrated from Abd Allah ibn Umar who said: While he – meaning Umar – was in the house, fearful, Al-As ibn Wa'il As-Sahmi, Abu Amr, came to him, wearing a *sabra* cloak and a shirt trimmed with silk. He was from Banu Sahm, our allies during the *Jahiliyyah*. He asked him: “What is the matter with you?” He replied: “Your people claim that they will kill me if I embrace Islam.” Al-As said: “No one can reach you.” – After he said that, Umar felt safe. Al-As went out and met the people who were streaming in the valley. He asked: “Where are you going?” They replied: “This Ibn al-Khattab who has apostatized.” He said: “No one can reach him.” So, the people turned back. In another wording, in Ibn Ishaq's narration, it is said: “By Allah, it was as if a cloth had been stripped from him (Umar).” This concerns the polytheists. As for the Muslims, Mujahid narrated from Ibn Abbas, who said: I asked Umar ibn al-Khattab, “Why were you named Al-Farooq (the Distinguisher)?” He replied: “Hamza embraced Islam three days before me.” – Then he narrated to him the story of his conversion and said at the end: “I said – meaning, when I embraced Islam – O Messenger of Allah, are we not upon the truth, whether we die or live?” He said: “Yes, by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, you are upon the truth whether you die or live.” He said: “I asked: Then why the concealment? By the One Who sent you with the truth, we will surely go out!” So, he led us out in two rows, Hamza in one and I in the other, with a rustling sound like the rustling of flour, until we entered the Mosque. He said: “I looked at Quraysh and at Hamza, and a depression overcame them that they had never felt before.” So, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) named me Al-Farooq that day. Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) used to say: “We were not able to pray near the Kaaba until Umar embraced Islam.” Suhayb ibn Sinan Ar-Rumi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When Umar embraced Islam, Islam was manifested, and the call to it was made openly. We sat in circles around the House, we circumambulated the House, we took our rights from those who were harsh towards us, and we responded to some of their attacks.” Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud said: “We have been respected ever since Umar embraced Islam.” The Representative of Quraysh before the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) : After the conversion of these two noble heroes – Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with them) – the clouds began to clear, and the polytheists awoke from their intoxication of inflicting torment and punishment upon the Muslims. They attempted a negotiation with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by lavishly offering him everything he might desire, so that he would cease his call. These poor souls did not realize that everything the sun rises upon was not worth the wing of a mosquito compared to his call. They failed and were frustrated in what they intended. Ibn Ishaq said: Yazid, Ziyad related to me from Muhammad ibn Ka'b Al-Qurazi, who said: I was told that Utbah ibn Rabi'ah, who was a chief, said one day while he was in the Quraysh gathering place and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sitting alone in the Mosque: “O people of Quraysh, should I not go to Muhammad? I will speak to him and offer him proposals, perhaps he will accept some of them, and we will give him whatever he wants, and he will leave us alone.” This was after Hamza (may Allah be pleased with him) had embraced Islam, and they saw the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) increasing in number. They said: “Yes, O Abu al-Walid, go to him and speak with him.” Utbah stood up and went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) until he sat beside him. He said: “O my nephew, you are among us in the high position in the clan and in the lineage that you know. But you have brought to your people a great matter by which you have divided their unity, deemed their dreams foolish, criticized their gods and their religion, and disbelieved in your ancestors who have passed away. So, listen to me. I will propose things to you; consider them, perhaps you will accept some of them.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Speak, O Abu al-Walid, I am listening.” He said: “O my nephew, if by this matter you only desire wealth, we will gather for you from our wealth so that you become the richest of us. If you desire honour, we will make you our chief so that we do not decide any matter without you. And if you desire kingship, we will make you our king. And if what comes to you is a spirit that you see and cannot repel from yourself, we will seek a remedy for you and spend our wealth on it until we cure you of it, for sometimes an affiliated spirit may overcome a man until he is treated for it,” – or similar words. When Utbah finished, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was listening to him, he said: “Have you finished, O Abu al-Walid?” He replied: “Yes.” The Prophet said: “Then listen to me.” He said: “I will.” Then the Prophet recited: {In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Hâ, Mîm. A revelation from the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. A Book whose verses have been detailed, an Arabic Quran for a people who know. A bearer of good news and a warner. But most of them turn away, so they do not hear. And they say: 'Our hearts are within coverings from that to which you invite us.'} [Fussilat: 1-5]. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) continued reciting it to him. When Utbah heard it from him, he listened intently, resting his hands behind his back, leaning on them to hear. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reached the verse of prostration in it and prostrated. Then he said: “O Abu al-Walid, you have heard what you have heard, so it is up to you.” Utbah stood up and went back to his companions. Some of them said to others: “We swear by Allah, Abu al-Walid has come back with a different face than the one he left with.” When he sat with them, they asked: “What is behind you, O Abu al-Walid?” He replied: “What is behind me is that I heard a speech. By Allah, I have never heard anything like it! By Allah, it is neither poetry, nor magic, nor soothsaying. O people of Quraysh, obey me and leave it to me: leave this man alone with what he is doing and isolate yourselves from him. For, by Allah, the speech I heard from him will have a great consequence. If the Arabs deal with him, you will be rid of him by others. And if he prevails over the Arabs, his kingship is your kingship, and his honour is your honour, and you will be the happiest of people because of him.” They said: “By Allah, O Abu al-Walid, he has bewitched you with his tongue.” He said: “This is my opinion about him, so do what you think best.” In another narration, Utbah listened until the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reached the saying of Allah (the Exalted): {But if they turn away, then say: 'I have warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt of 'Ad and Thamûd.'} [Fussilat: 13]. He stood up, terrified, and placed his hand over the mouth of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), saying: “I implore you by Allah and the bond of kinship!” This was out of fear that the warning would fall. He went to the people and said what he said. Abu Talib Gathers Banu Hashim and Banu Abd al-Muttalib: The course of circumstances changed, and situations and conditions were altered, but Abu Talib did not cease to fear ill-will from the polytheists towards his nephew. He considered the past events – the polytheists had threatened him with combat, then they had tried to negotiate the exchange of his nephew for Umara ibn al-Walid to kill him, Abu Jahl had gone to his nephew with a stone to crush him, Uqbah ibn Abi Mu'ayt had strangled his nephew with his cloak and almost killed him, Ibn al-Khattab had gone out with a sword to eliminate his nephew – Abu Talib pondered these events and sensed an air of evil that made his heart tremble. He became certain that the polytheists were determined to violate their pledge of protection, determined to kill his nephew. What good would Hamza or Umar or others be if one of the polytheists suddenly rushed upon his nephew? This became certain to Abu Talib, and it was only the truth, for they had unanimously agreed to kill the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) openly. There is an allusion to this consensus in the saying of Allah (the Exalted): {Or have they determined [upon] a matter? Then indeed, We are determining [it].} [Az-Zukhruf: 79]. So, what was Abu Talib to do? When he saw the coalition of Quraysh against his nephew, he stood up among his family from Banu Hashim and Banu al-Muttalib, descendants of Abd Manaf, and called them to uphold his stand of protecting his nephew and standing up for him. Both their Muslims and their disbelievers answered him out of zeal for the Arab covenant of protection, except for his brother, Abu Lahab, who left them and joined Quraysh. The Last Delegation of Quraysh to Abu Talib The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left the mountain pass (*Shi'b*) and continued to act according to his nature. Although Quraysh had ceased the boycott, they remained acting according to their nature of pressuring the Muslims and obstructing the path of Allah. As for Abu Talib, he continued to protect his nephew, but he was over eighty years old. The continuous pains and immense events over the years – especially the siege in the pass – had weakened and enfeebled his joints and broken his resolve. Only a few months after his departure from the pass, he was overtaken by sickness, and it intensified. At that point, the polytheists feared a bad reputation among the Arabs if they committed an outrage against his nephew after his death. They tried one more time to negotiate with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in his presence, and to offer some of what they had refused to give before. Thus, they formed a delegation, which was their last, to Abu Talib. Ibn Ishaq and others said: When Abu Talib fell ill, and Quraysh learned of his grave condition, some of Quraysh said to others: “Hamza and Umar have embraced Islam, and the affair of Muhammad has spread throughout all the tribes of Quraysh. Let us go to Abu Talib, so that he may take a pledge from his nephew and give us a pledge from him. By Allah, we do not feel safe that they will seize our authority from us.” In another wording: “We fear that this old man may die and something happen to him, and the Arabs would fault us, saying they left him alone until his uncle died, then they seized him.” They went to Abu Talib and spoke to him. They were the chiefs of his people: Utbah ibn Rabi'ah, Shaybah ibn Rabi'ah, Abu Jahl ibn Hisham, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, and Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, among other men of their nobility – about twenty-five men. They said: “O Abu Talib, you are among us in the position you know, and what you see has befallen you, and we fear for you. You know what is between us and your nephew. Summon him, take a pledge for him from us, and take a pledge for us from him, so that he will leave us alone, and we will leave him alone, and he will leave us our religion, and we will leave him his religion.” Abu Talib sent for him, and he came. Abu Talib said: “O my nephew, these are the chiefs of your people. They have gathered for you, to offer you (something) and to take (a pledge) from you.” He then informed him of what they had said and their proposal of mutual non-aggression. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to them: “What do you think if I gave you one word, by which you would possess the Arabs, and by which the non-Arabs would submit to you?” In one wording, addressing Abu Talib, he said: “I want them to utter one word by which the Arabs will submit to them, and by which the non-Arabs will pay them the *Jizyah* (tribute).” In another wording, he said: “O my uncle, would you not invite them to what is better for them?” He asked: “And what do you invite them to?” He replied: “I invite them to utter one word by which the Arabs will submit to them, and by which they will possess the non-Arabs.” And in the wording of Ibn Ishaq's narration: “One word you utter, by which you will possess the Arabs, and by which the non-Arabs will submit to you.” When he spoke these words, they paused and were bewildered, not knowing how to refuse this single word that was so beneficial and far-reaching. Then Abu Jahl said: “What is it? By your father, we will give it to you and ten times its like!” He said: “You say: 'There is no god but Allah,' and you renounce what you worship besides Him.” They clapped their hands, then said: “Do you want, O Muhammad, to make the gods into one God? Your affair is truly astonishing!” Then some of them said to others: “By Allah, this man will not give you anything you want. So, go and hold fast to the religion of your fathers until Allah judges between you and him.” Then they dispersed. Concerning these very people, the saying of Allah (the Exalted) was revealed: {Sâd. By the Quran, full of Reminder. But those who disbelieve are in pride and dissension. How many generations have We destroyed before them of a time, and they cried out, but there was not a time to escape. And they wonder that a warner has come to them from among themselves; and the disbelievers say: 'This is a sorcerer and a liar. Has he made the gods [into] one God? Indeed, this is a remarkable thing.' And the eminent among them went forth, [saying], 'Continue and be patient over your gods. Indeed, this is a thing intended. We have not heard of this in the latest religion. This is not but an invention.'} [Sâd: 1-7]. The Year of Sorrow – The Death of Abu Talib: The illness intensified for Abu Talib, and it was not long before death came to him. His death occurred in Rajab of the tenth year of the Prophethood, six months after leaving the pass. It is also said: He died in the month of Ramadan, three days before the death of Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her). In *Sahih* (authentic collection) from Al-Musayyab, when Abu Talib was at the point of death, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon him, and Abu Jahl was present. The Prophet said: “O my uncle, say: 'There is no god but Allah,' a word with which I will argue for you before Allah.” Abu Jahl and Abd Allah ibn Abi Umayyah said: “O Abu Talib, do you renounce the religion of Abd al-Muttalib?” They kept speaking to him until the last thing he said to them was that he was upon the religion of Abd al-Muttalib. Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I will ask forgiveness for you as long as I am not forbidden to do so.” Then the verse was revealed: {It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the Hellfire.} [At-Tawbah: 113], and the verse was revealed: {Indeed, you do not guide whom you love.} [Al-Qasas: 56]. There is no need to explain the protection and support that Abu Talib gave. He was the fortress with which the Islamic call was protected from the attacks of the chiefs and the ruffians. However, he remained upon the religion of the elders of his ancestors and did not achieve complete success. In the *Sahih*, Al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “What benefit did you bring to your uncle, for he used to protect you and get angry on your behalf?” He replied: “He is in a shallow puddle of fire. If it were not for me, he would have been in the lowest level of the Fire.” On the authority of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – when his uncle was mentioned – say: “Perhaps my intercession will benefit him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be placed in a shallow puddle of fire that reaches his ankles.” Khadijah goes to the Mercy of Allah: About two months, or three days, after the death of Abu Talib – according to the difference of opinion – Umm al-Mu'minin Khadijah al-Kubra (may Allah be pleased with her) died. Her death occurred in the month of Ramadan of the tenth year of the Prophethood. She was sixty-five years old, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was fifty years old at that time. Khadijah was one of the great blessings of Allah upon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). She remained with him for a quarter of a century, comforting him in his moments of anxiety, supporting him in his most critical times, helping him convey his message, sharing with him the bitter hardships of *Jihad*, and consoling him with her person and her wealth. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “She believed in me when people disbelieved in me, she accepted me as truthful when people called me a liar, she shared her wealth with me when people deprived me, and Allah granted me children from her, and denied them from others.” In the *Sahih*, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah, he said: Gabriel came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, this is Khadijah, she is coming, and she has with her a vessel containing seasoning, food, or drink. When she comes to you, convey to her the greetings from her Lord, and give her the good news of a house in Paradise made of hollow, polished pearls (or reeds), where there will be neither noise nor toil.” The Accumulation of Sorrows: These two painful events occurred within a few days. Feelings of grief and pain shook the heart of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Then, the calamities from his people continued to befall him. They became more daring towards him, openly inflicting punishment and harm after Abu Talib's death. His grief increased upon grief, so much so that he despaired of them. He went out to At-Ta'if, hoping that they would respond to his call, or give him refuge and support against his people. But he found neither shelter nor supporter. Moreover, they harmed him with the severest of injuries, inflicting upon him what his own people had not inflicted. The pressure from the people of Mecca on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) intensified, and it also intensified upon his Companions, to the extent that his companion Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) resorted to emigration from Mecca. He set out until he reached Bark al-Ghimad, intending to go to Abyssinia, but Ibn Ad-Dughunnah brought him back under his protection. Ibn Ishaq said: When Abu Talib died, Quraysh inflicted upon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) such harm as they had not dared to hope for during Abu Talib's lifetime. A fool among the fools of Quraysh intercepted him and scattered dust upon his head. He entered his house with the dust on his head. One of his daughters stood up and began washing the dust from his head while weeping. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her: “Do not weep, my little daughter, for Allah will protect your father.” He also said during this time: “Quraysh did not do anything to me that I disliked until Abu Talib died.” Because of the succession of such pains in this year, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) named it The Year of Sorrow, and it became known by this title in history. Marriage to Sawdah (may Allah be pleased with her) : In Shawwal of this same year, the 10th year of the Prophethood, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married Sawdah bint Zam'ah. She was one of those who embraced Islam early and had participated in the second emigration to Abyssinia. Her husband, As-Sakran ibn Amr, had embraced Islam and emigrated with her, but he died in Abyssinia or after returning to Mecca. When her waiting period ended, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) proposed to her and married her. She was the first woman he married after the death of Khadijah. After several years, she gifted her turn to A'ishah. The Isra and the Mi'raj (The Night Journey and the Ascension) While the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was in this phase where his call was carving a path between success and persecution, and faint stars were glimmering on distant horizons, the event of the Isra and the Mi'raj occurred. There is a difference of opinion regarding the exact timing of the event: It was said: The Isra took place in the year Allah honoured him with Prophethood. This was the view chosen by At-Tabari. It was said: It was five years after the beginning of the Prophetic Mission. This was the preferred view of An-Nawawi and Al-Qurtubi. It was said: It was on the night of the twenty-seventh of Rajab in the 10th year of the Prophethood. This was the view chosen by the scholar Al-Mansurpuri. It was said: Sixteen months before the Hijra, meaning in the month of Ramadan of the 12th year of the Prophethood. It was said: One year and two months before the Hijra, meaning in Muharram of the 13th year of the Prophethood. It was said: One year before the Hijra, meaning in Rabi' al-Awwal of the 13th year of the Prophethood. The first three opinions are refuted by the fact that Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) died in Ramadan of the tenth year of the Prophethood, and her death occurred before the five daily prayers were prescribed. It is unanimously agreed that the five prayers were made obligatory on the night of the Isra. As for the remaining three opinions, I found nothing to prefer one over the others, except that the context of Surah *Al-Isra* (The Night Journey) indicates that the Isra was very late. The imams of Hadith narrated the details of this event. We summarize them as follows: Ibn al-Qayyim said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was transported by night, with his body according to the most authentic view, from the Sacred Mosque (Mecca) to Al-Aqsa Mosque (Jerusalem), riding Al-Burâq, accompanied by Gabriel (peace and blessings be upon them). He dismounted there, prayed as the Imam of the Prophets, and tied Al-Burâq to the ring of the Mosque door. Then, he ascended that night from Jerusalem to the first Heaven. Gabriel requested the opening for him, and it was opened. There he saw Adam, the father of mankind. He greeted him, and Adam welcomed him, returned the greeting, and acknowledged his Prophethood. Allah showed him the souls of the martyrs on his right and the souls of the wretched on his left. Then, he ascended to the second Heaven. Gabriel requested the opening for him, and it was opened. There he saw Yahya ibn Zakariyyah and 'Isa ibn Maryam (John and Jesus). He met them and greeted them. They returned the greeting, welcomed him, and acknowledged his Prophethood. Then, he ascended to the third Heaven. There he saw Yusuf (Joseph). He greeted him. He returned the greeting, welcomed him, and acknowledged his Prophethood. Then, he ascended to the fourth Heaven. There he saw Idris. He greeted him, welcomed him, and acknowledged his Prophethood. Then, he ascended to the fifth Heaven. There he saw Harun ibn 'Imran (Aaron). He greeted him, welcomed him, and acknowledged his Prophethood. Then, he ascended to the sixth Heaven. There he met Musa ibn 'Imran (Moses). He greeted him, welcomed him, and acknowledged his Prophethood. When he passed him, Musa wept. He was asked: “What makes you weep?” He replied: “I weep because a young man sent after me will enter Paradise with more of his community than will enter with my community.” Then, he ascended to the seventh Heaven. There he met Ibrahim (Abraham) (peace be upon him). He greeted him, welcomed him, and acknowledged his Prophethood. Then, he was raised to Sidrat al-Muntaha (the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary), and then Al-Bayt al-Ma'mur (the Frequented House) was raised up for him. Then, he ascended to Al-Jabbâr (the All-Powerful), exalted be His Majesty. He drew near to Him until he was at the distance of two bow lengths or nearer. Allah then revealed to His servant what He revealed, and He obligated fifty prayers upon him. He returned until he passed Musa. Musa asked him: “What were you commanded?” He replied: “Fifty prayers.” Musa said: “Your community will not be able to bear that. Return to your Lord and ask Him for a reduction for your community.” The Prophet looked at Gabriel, as if consulting him about that. He gestured: “Yes, if you wish.” Gabriel ascended with him until he reached Al-Jabbâr (Blessed and Exalted be He), who was in His place – this is the wording of Al-Bukhari in some narrations. He removed ten prayers from him. Then, he descended until he passed Musa, and informed him. Musa said: “Return to your Lord and ask for a reduction.” He kept going back and forth between Musa and Allah (Mighty and Majestic) until He made them five. Musa ordered him to return and ask for a reduction. The Prophet said: “I am ashamed of my Lord. I am content and submit.” When he moved away, a caller cried out: “I have confirmed My obligation and lightened it for My servants.” End of quote. Ibn al-Qayyim then mentioned the difference of opinion regarding the Prophet's vision (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) of his Lord (Blessed and Exalted be He), and then mentioned the words of Ibn Taymiyyah in this regard. The conclusion of the research is that the vision with the eye is not established as evidence, and it is a saying that none of the Companions upheld. As for what was narrated from Ibn Abbas concerning the absolute vision and the vision with the heart, the former does not contradict the latter. He then said: “As for His saying (the Exalted) in Surah *An-Najm* (The Star): {Then he approached and descended} [An-Najm: 8], this ‘drawing near’ is different from the one in the Isra story. The ‘drawing near’ in Surah *An-Najm* is the drawing near and descent of Gabriel, as 'A'ishah and Ibn Mas'ud said, and the context indicates it. As for the drawing near and descent in the Hadith of the Isra, that is explicit that it is the drawing near and descent of the Lord (Blessed and Exalted be He). Surah *An-Najm* does not address that. Rather, it mentions that he saw him (Gabriel) a second time at Sidrat al-Muntaha. This is Gabriel, whom Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw in his (true) form twice: once on earth, and once at Sidrat al-Muntaha. And Allah knows best.” End of quote. The incident of the splitting of his chest (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also occurred this time. During this journey, he saw numerous things. He was offered milk and wine. He chose the milk. It was said to him: “You have been guided to the *Fitrah* (primordial nature) or you have attained the *Fitrah*. If you had taken the wine, your community would have been misguided.” He saw four rivers in Paradise: two visible and two hidden. The two visible ones are the Nile and the Euphrates. This means that his message would be established in the fertile valleys of the Nile and the Euphrates, and its people would be the carriers of Islam generation after generation. It does not mean that the water of the two rivers originates from Paradise. He saw Malik, the keeper of the Fire, who did not smile, and whose face showed neither cheerfulness nor joy. He also saw Paradise and the Fire. He saw the wrongful devourers of the property of orphans. They had lips like the lips of camels. Chunks of fire, like boulders, were thrown into their mouths and came out of their posteriors. He saw the devourers of usury. They had large bellies because of which they could not move from their place, and the people of Pharaoh passed by when they were presented to the Fire, trampling upon them. He saw the fornicators. They had good, fat meat before them, and next to it, thin, stinking meat. They were eating the thin, stinking meat and leaving the good, fat meat. He saw the women who introduced to men children who were not their own. He saw them suspended by their breasts. He saw a caravan of the people of Mecca coming and going, and he guided them to a camel that had run away from them, and he drank their water from a covered vessel while they were sleeping, then left the vessel covered. This became proof of the truth of his claim on the morning of the night of the Isra. Ibn al-Qayyim said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reached his people in the morning, he informed them of what Allah (Mighty and Majestic) had shown him of His greater signs. Their denial of him intensified, as did their harm and pressure against him. They asked him to describe Al-Aqsa Mosque. Allah made it visible to him, so he saw it clearly. He began to inform them of its signs, and they could not refute anything he said. He informed them about their caravan on its journey and return, informed them of the time of its arrival, and informed them about the camel that was leading it. And the matter was exactly as he said. But that only increased their aversion, and the unjust refused everything but disbelief. It is said that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) was named As-Siddiq (the Truthful) because of his confirmation of this event when the people denied it. The most concise and greatest justification for this journey is the saying of Allah (the Exalted): {That We might show him some of Our signs.} [Al-Isra: 1]. This is the way of Allah with the Prophets. He said: {And thus did We show Abraham the realm of the heavens and the earth that he would be among the firm believers.} [Al-An'am: 75], and He said to Moses: {That We might show you [some] of Our greatest signs.} [Ta-Ha: 23]. The purpose of this will is explained by His saying: {that he would be among the firm believers.} After the Prophets' knowledge is based on seeing the signs, they attain a certainty of conviction that cannot be estimated. Hearing is not like seeing. They can then endure in the path of Allah what others cannot endure, and all the powers of the world become to them like the wing of a mosquito, which they do not heed when faced with trials and torments. As for the wisdoms and secrets that lie behind the details of this journey, their place of research is in the books on the mysteries of the Sharia (Islamic law). But here are simple facts that spring forth from the sources of this blessed journey and flow into the gardens of the Prophet's Biography (peace and blessings and salutations be upon him). I deem it appropriate to briefly mention some of them. The reader sees in Surah *Al-Isra* that Allah mentioned the story of the Isra in only one verse, and then began mentioning the scandals and crimes of the Jews, and then alerted them that this Quran guides to that which is most upright. The reader might assume there is no link between the two verses, but that is not the case. By this style, Allah (the Exalted) indicates that the Isra occurred to Jerusalem only because the Jews were about to be removed from the position of leadership of the human nation, due to the crimes they had committed, which left no room for their retention of this position. And that Allah would effectively transfer this position to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), uniting for him both centres of the Abrahamic call. The time had come for the spiritual leadership to be transferred from one nation to another, from a nation that filled its history with treachery, betrayal, sin, and aggression, to a nation that overflows with righteousness and goodness, and whose Messenger still enjoys the revelation of the Quran that guides to that which is most upright. But how can this leadership be transferred while the Messenger is wandering in the mountains of Mecca, driven away among the people? This question lifts the veil from another truth, which is that one phase of this Islamic call was nearing its end and completion, and another phase, different from the first in its course, was about to begin. Therefore, we see some verses containing a blatant warning and severe threat to the polytheists: {And when We intend to destroy a city, We command its affluent ones [to obey Us], but they defiantly disobey therein; so the word [of decree] comes into effect upon it, and We destroy it with complete destruction.} [Al-Isra: 16], {And how many generations have We destroyed after Noah! And sufficient is your Lord as an All-Knower and All-Seer of the sins of His servants.} [Al-Isra: 17]. Alongside these verses are other verses that explain to the Muslims the principles and clauses of civilization upon which their Islamic society is to be built, as if they have taken refuge in a land where they control their affairs in all respects, and form a cohesive unit around which the mill of society revolves. This indicates that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would find a sanctuary and a safe haven where his affair would be established, and it would become a centre for spreading his call throughout the world. This is one of the secrets of this blessed journey, related to our research, so we chose to mention it. It is for this wisdom and similar reasons that we see the Isra occurred either just before the First Pledge of Aqabah or between the two pledges. And Allah knows best. – The Hijra (Emigration) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) When the tyrannical decision to kill the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was made, Gabriel descended to him with the revelation from his Lord (Blessed and Exalted be He). He informed him of the Quraysh conspiracy, and that Allah had permitted him to leave and specified the time of the Hijra, saying: “Do not spend this night in the bed on which you usually sleep.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) in the midday heat to finalize the stages of the Hijra with him. 'A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: While we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house in the heat of midday, someone said to Abu Bakr: “This is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) coming, covering his face, at an hour when he did not usually come to us.” Abu Bakr said: “May my father and mother be sacrificed for him! By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for an important matter.” She said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and asked for permission to enter. He was granted permission and entered. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Bakr: “Ask those who are with you to leave.” Abu Bakr said: “They are only your family members. May my father be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah.” The Prophet said: “I have been permitted to leave.” Abu Bakr asked: “The companionship, may my father be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) replied: “Yes.” After finalizing the plan of the Hijra, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) returned to his house to await the coming of the night. The Siege of the Messenger of Allah's House: As for the major criminals of Quraysh, they spent their day preparing to execute the plan that the Mecca parliament, *Dar an-Nadwah* (the Council Hall), had ratified in the morning. Eleven chiefs from these notables were chosen for this purpose: 1. Abu Jahl ibn Hisham. 2. Al-Hakam ibn Abi al-'As. 3. Uqbah ibn Abi Mu'ayt. 4. An-Nadr ibn al-Hârith. 5. Umayyah ibn Khalaf. 6. Zam'ah ibn al-Aswad. 7. Tu'aymah ibn 'Adiyy. 8. Abu Lahab. 9. Ubayy ibn Khalaf. 10. Nabîh ibn al-Hajjâj. 11. Munabbih ibn al-Hajjâj. Ibn Ishaq said: When the early part of the night came, they gathered at his door, watching for when he would fall asleep, so they could rush upon him. They were confident and absolutely certain of the success of this vile conspiracy. Abu Jahl stood in a posture of pride and arrogance, addressing his companions surrounding the house with sarcasm and mockery: “Muhammad claims that if you follow him in his matter, you will be the kings of the Arabs and the non-Arabs, and then you will be resurrected after your death, and gardens like the gardens of Jordan will be made for you. And if you do not do that, there will be slaughter for you from him, and then you will be resurrected after your death, and a Fire will be made for you in which you will be burned.” The appointed time for the execution of that conspiracy was after midnight. They stayed awake, awaiting zero hour. But Allah prevails over His command, and the dominion of the heavens and the earth is in His Hand. He does what He wills, and He grants protection, and no protection can be granted against Him. He carried out what He addressed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) later: {And [remember, O Muhammad], when those who disbelieved plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or exile you. They plan, and Allah plans. And Allah is the best of planners.} [Al-Anfâl: 30]. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Leaves His House: Despite the extreme preparedness of Quraysh to execute their plan, they failed miserably. In this critical hour, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Ali ibn Abi Talib: 'Sleep on my bed, and cover yourself with this green Hadrami cloak of mine. Sleep in it, for nothing they wish for you that you dislike will reach you.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sleep in that cloak when he slept. They were certain and absolutely convinced of the success of this vile conspiracy, so much so that Abu Jahl stood up with pride and arrogance, addressing his surrounding companions with sarcasm and mockery, saying: 'Muhammad claims that if you follow him in his command, you will be the kings of the Arabs and the non-Arabs, and then be resurrected after your death, and you will be given gardens like the gardens of Urdunn. And if you do not, he will have a slaughter amongst you, and then you will be resurrected after your death, and then you will be assigned to a fire in which you will be burned.' The appointed time for the execution of that conspiracy was after midnight. They stayed awake, waiting for the zero hour, but Allah is predominant over His Command, the dominion of the heavens and the earth is in His hand, He does what He wills, and He grants refuge, but none can be granted refuge against Him. He did what He addressed the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with later: {And [remember] when the disbelievers plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or exile you. They plot, and Allah plots. And Allah is the best of plotters.} [Al-Anfal: 30]. Despite the extreme preparedness of Quraysh to execute their plan, they failed miserably. In this critical hour, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Ali ibn Abi Talib: 'Sleep on my bed, and cover yourself with this green Hadrami cloak of mine. Sleep in it, for nothing they wish for you that you dislike will reach you.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sleep in that cloak when he slept. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out, passed through their ranks, took a handful of pebbles and began to scatter it over their heads. Allah had taken away their sights from him, and they did not see him, as he recited: {And We have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them, so they do not see.} [Ya-Sin: 9]. Not a single man among them remained but had dust placed on his head. He then proceeded to the house of Abu Bakr, and they both exited through a small opening in Abu Bakr's house at night until they reached the Cave of Thawr in the direction of Yemen. The besiegers remained waiting for the zero hour to arrive, but just before it arrived, disappointment and failure became apparent to them. A man who was not with them came, saw them at his door, and said: 'What are you waiting for?' They said: 'Muhammad.' He said: 'You have failed and lost. By Allah, he passed by you, scattered dust on your heads, and went away for his need.' They said: 'By Allah, we did not see him.' They stood up, dusting the dirt from their heads. But they looked through the gap in the door and saw Ali. They said: 'By Allah, that is Muhammad sleeping, with his cloak upon him.' They remained like that until morning. Ali got up from the bed, and they were at a loss. They asked him about the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he said: 'I have no knowledge of him.' From the House to the Cave: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left his house on the night of the 27th of Safar, in the 14th year of Prophethood, corresponding to September 12\/13, 622 CE. He went to the house of his companion – the most trusted person to him in his company and wealth – Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him). Then they left the latter's house through a back door, to exit Mecca in haste, before the dawn broke. Since the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) knew that Quraysh would search for him diligently, and that the path to which attention would first turn was the main road to Medina, heading north, he took the completely opposite road, which was the one located south of Mecca, heading towards Yemen. He travelled this path for about five miles until he reached a mountain known as Jabal Thawr. This is a lofty mountain, rugged in terrain, difficult to ascend, with many stones. The feet of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) became bruised. It is also said that he walked on the tips of his feet on the road to hide his tracks, which bruised his feet. Whatever the case, Abu Bakr carried him when they reached the mountain and hurried with him until he reached a cave at the top of the mountain, known historically as the Cave of Thawr. When They Were in the Cave: When they reached the cave, Abu Bakr said: 'By Allah, you will not enter it until I enter before you, so that if there is anything in it, it will strike me instead of you.' He entered and swept it, and found holes on its side. He tore his lower garment and blocked them with it. Two remained, so he blocked them with his feet. Then he said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 'Enter.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered, placed his head on his lap and slept. Abu Bakr was stung in his leg from one of the holes, but he did not move for fear of waking the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). His tears fell onto the face of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said: 'What is the matter with you, O Abu Bakr?' He said: 'I have been stung, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spat on it, and the pain left his body. They remained hidden in the cave for three nights: the night of Friday, the night of Saturday, and the night of Sunday. Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr used to spend the night with them. Aisha said that he was an intelligent and perceptive young man. He would leave them before dawn and arrive in Mecca among Quraysh as if he had spent the night there. He would not hear of any plot being devised against them except that he would retain it, until he came to them with the news when darkness fell. And Amir ibn Fuhayra, Abu Bakr's freed slave, used to graze for them a gift of sheep, and he would bring them to rest for them when an hour of the evening had passed, and they would spend the night drinking the milk of those sheep (their milk and preserved food) until Amir ibn Fuhayra would drive them away just before dawn. He did this every night of those three nights. Amir ibn Fuhayra would follow the tracks of Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr with his sheep after he left for Mecca, in order to erase them. As for Quraysh, they went mad when they confirmed that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had escaped on the night the plot was to be executed. The first thing they did was to beat Ali, drag him to the Kaaba, and imprison him for an hour, hoping to extract news of the two men. When they got no benefit from Ali, they came to Abu Bakr's house and knocked on his door. Asma bint Abi Bakr came out to them. They asked her: 'Where is your father?' She said: 'By Allah, I do not know where my father is.' Abu Jahl raised his hand – he was a foul and malicious man – and slapped her on the cheek, knocking off her earring. Quraysh decided in an urgent emergency session to use all available means to capture the two men. They placed all the roads leading out of Mecca (in all directions) under strict armed surveillance. They also decided to give a huge reward of one hundred camels for each of the two men to whoever would return them to Quraysh, dead or alive, whoever that person might be. Thereupon, horsemen, infantry, and trackers worked diligently in the search, spreading out into the mountains, valleys, lowlands, and plateaus, but without success or gain. The pursuers reached the entrance of the cave, but Allah is predominant over His Command. Al-Bukhari narrated from Anas from Abu Bakr who said: 'I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the cave, and I raised my head, and behold, I saw the feet of the people. I said: 'O Prophet of Allah, if one of them were to look down, he would see us.' He said: 'Be quiet, O Abu Bakr. Two, and Allah is their third.' In another narration: 'What do you think, O Abu Bakr, of two whose third is Allah?' It was a miracle with which Allah honored His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The pursuers turned back when there were only a few steps between them and him. On the Way to Medina: When the fire of the search subsided, the operations of the inspection patrols ceased, and the fury of Quraysh calmed down after a continuous intense pursuit of three days without avail, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companion prepared to leave for Medina. They had hired Abdullah ibn Urayqit al-Laythi, who was an expert and skillful guide – proficient in the route – who was on the religion of the disbelievers of Quraysh, and they trusted him with that. They handed over their two riding camels to him, and arranged to meet him at the Cave of Thawr after three nights with the camels. When it was the night of Monday – the first of Rabi' al-Awwal in the 1st year AH \/ September 16, 622 CE – Abdullah ibn Urayqit came to them with the two riding camels. At that moment, Abu Bakr said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 'May my father be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah, take one of these two riding camels,' and he offered him the best of them. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'For the price.' Asma bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) brought them their provisions bag, and forgot to make a strap for it. When they were about to depart, she went to hang the provisions bag, but found it had no strap. She tore her waist belt into two, hung the provisions bag with one piece, and tied the other piece around her waist, and so she was named *Dhat al-Nitaqayn* (The Possessor of the Two Belts). Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) departed, and Amir ibn Fuhayra travelled with them. The guide – Abdullah ibn Urayqit – took them along the coastal road. The first route he took after leaving the cave was to proceed far south towards Yemen, then head west towards the coast. When he reached a road that people were unfamiliar with, he headed north close to the shore of the Red Sea, taking a path that was rarely travelled by anyone. Ibn Ishaq mentioned the places the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed through on this road. He said: When the guide left with them, he took them below Mecca, then proceeded with them along the coast until he intersected the road below Usfan, then he took them below Amj, then passed with them until he intersected the road after passing Qudayd, then he passed with them from that place. He took them through Al-Kharrar, then through Thaniyyat al-Murra, then through Laqf, then he passed with them through Mudlajatu Laqf, then descended with them into Mudlajatu Mujah, then through Marajh Mahaj, then through the bottom of Marajh Dhil-Ghuduwayn, then the bottom of Dhi Kushr, then he took them through Al-Jadajid, then through Al-Ajrad, then through Dhu Salam, from the bottom of A'da' Mudlajatu Ta'han, then through Al-Ababid, then he passed with them through Al-Fajja, then he descended with them to Al-Arj, then he took them through Thaniyyat al-A'ir – to the right of Rukubah – until he descended with them to Batn Ri'm, then he brought them to Quba. Here are some incidents that occurred on the way: 1. Al-Bukhari narrated from Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: 'We travelled our night and the next day until the heat of noon stood still, and the road was empty, no one passing by. A tall rock appeared to us with a shade that the sun had not yet reached. We dismounted by it, and I leveled a place for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with my hand for him to sleep on, and I spread a sheepskin over it. I said: 'Sleep, O Messenger of Allah, and I will clear for you what is around you.' He slept, and I went out to clear what was around him. Suddenly, I saw a shepherd approaching with his sheep towards the rock, wanting from it what we had wanted. I asked him: 'Whose are you, O boy?' He said: 'A man from the people of Medina or Mecca.' I asked: 'Is there any milk in your sheep?' He said: 'Yes.' I asked: 'Will you milk?' He said: 'Yes.' He took a sheep, and I said: 'Wipe the dust, hair, and filth from the udder.' He milked a small amount of milk into a hollow vessel. I had with me a waterskin that I had brought for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for him to drink and perform ablution from. I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and I disliked waking him. I met him when he woke up. I poured water on the milk until the bottom was cool. I said: 'Drink, O Messenger of Allah.' He drank until I was satisfied. Then he said: 'Is it not time to depart?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Then we departed.' 2. It was the custom of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was riding behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He was an older man who was known, and the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was young and not known. A man would meet Abu Bakr and say: 'Who is this man in front of you?' He would say: 'This man is guiding me to the path,' and the questioner would assume he meant the physical road, but he only meant the way of goodness. 3. Suraqa ibn Malik pursued them on the road. Suraqa said: 'While I was sitting in an assembly of my people, Banu Mudlij, a man from them came forward and stood over us while we were sitting, and said: 'O Suraqa, I saw silhouettes just now by the coast, I think they are Muhammad and his companions.' Suraqa said: 'I knew they were them.' I said to him: 'They are not them, but you saw so-and-so and so-and-so who departed before our eyes.' I stayed in the assembly for an hour, then I got up and went inside. I ordered my servant girl to bring out my mare, which was behind a small hill, and hold her for me. I took my spear and went out with it from the back of the house. I traced a line with its tip on the ground and lowered its upper end until I reached my mare. I mounted her, and she hurried me forward until I was close to them. My mare stumbled with me, and I fell off. I stood up, put my hand into my quiver, took out the divining arrows, and sought to know if I would harm them or not. The result came out as the one I disliked. I mounted my mare and disobeyed the arrows. She hurried me forward until I heard the recitation of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – who did not look back, while Abu Bakr looked back often – the forelegs of my mare sank into the ground up to the knees. I fell off her. Then I rebuked her and she got up, barely able to pull out her feet. When she stood upright, the dust rising from her forelegs was like smoke in the sky. I sought the omen with the divining arrows again, and the result came out as the one I disliked. I called out to them for safety (*aman*), and they stopped. I mounted my mare until I came to them. It occurred to me, when I encountered what I did in being restrained from them, that the affair of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would prevail. I told him that my people had set a reward for you, and I informed them of the news of what the people intended for them. I offered them provisions and goods, but they did not take anything from me, nor did they ask me for anything except that he said: 'Keep our secret.' I asked him to write for me a document of security. He ordered Amir ibn Fuhayra, who wrote it for me on a piece of leather. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) proceeded. Arrival at Quba: On Monday, 8th of Rabi' al-Awwal in the 14th year of Prophethood – which is the first year of the Hijra – corresponding to September 23, 622 CE, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) arrived at Quba. Urwah ibn Az-Zubayr said: The Muslims in Medina heard about the departure of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from Mecca, and they used to go out every morning to the Harra (rocky plateau) to wait for him until the heat of noon forced them back. One day they returned after a long wait, and when they reached their homes, a man from the Jews climbed up one of their fortresses for some purpose he was looking at. He caught sight of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions, dressed in white, moving with the mirage. The Jew could not help but shout at the top of his voice: 'O company of Arabs, this is your good fortune that you were waiting for!' The Muslims rushed to their weapons. Ibn Al-Qayyim said: And the clamor and *Takbir* (saying *Allahu Akbar*) were heard in Banu Amr ibn Auf. The Muslims said *Allahu Akbar* in joy at his arrival, and went out to meet him. They received him and greeted him with the salutation of Prophethood, surrounding him on all sides. Serenity covered him, and the Revelation descended upon him: {But if you assist one another against him, then indeed Allah is his Protector, and Gabriel and the righteous among the believers, and the angels, moreover, are his helpers.} [At-Tahrim: 4]. Urwah ibn Az-Zubayr said: They received the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he turned with them to the right until he stopped at Banu Amr ibn Auf. That was on Monday in the month of Rabi' al-Awwal. Abu Bakr stood up to address the people, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat silently. Those of the Ansar who had not seen the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) began to greet – or in one version, to come to – Abu Bakr, until the sun struck the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Then Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his cloak. It was then that the people recognized the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The entirety of Medina had marched out for the reception. It was a momentous historical day, unlike any Medina had witnessed in its history. The Jews saw the truth of the good news concerning the Prophet, that God would come from Tayman, and the Holy One from the mountains of Paran. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stayed at Quba with Kulthum ibn Al-Hidm. It is said that it was rather with Sa'd ibn Khaythama, but the former is more established. Ali ibn Abi Talib remained in Mecca for three days to return the deposits that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) held for the people. Then he migrated on foot until he caught up with them at Quba, and stayed with Kulthum ibn Al-Hidm. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stayed at Quba for four days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. He established the Mosque of Quba and prayed in it; it is the first mosque founded on piety after the Prophethood. On the fifth day – Friday – he mounted his ride by the command of Allah, with Abu Bakr riding behind him. He sent for Banu An-Najjar – his maternal uncles – and they came wearing their swords. He proceeded towards Medina, and the Friday prayer caught up with him at Banu Salim ibn Auf. He led them in the Friday prayer in the mosque in the bottom of the valley. They were one hundred men. Entering Medina: After the Friday prayer, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered Medina – and from that day the town of Yathrib was called the City of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), abbreviated to *Al-Madinah* – and it was a glorious historical day. The houses and streets were resounding with the sounds of praise and glorification (*tahmid* and *taqdis*). The girls of the Ansar were singing these verses in joy and happiness: The full moon has risen upon us from the valleys of Wada' * And gratitude is incumbent upon us as long as a caller calls to Allah * O you who were sent among us, you have come with a command that must be obeyed. Even though the Ansar were not people of vast wealth, every one of them wished for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to stay with him. He would not pass by a house of the Ansar but they would seize the rein of his riding camel, saying: 'Come to us, we have the number, the equipment, the weapons, and the protection.' He would say to them: 'Leave her way, for she is commanded.' She continued walking with him until she reached the place of the Prophet's Mosque today and knelt down. He did not dismount until she got up and walked a little, then turned back, returned, and knelt down in her first place. He dismounted from her, and that was with Banu An-Najjar – his maternal uncles (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This was by the success granted to her by Allah, for He loved for him to stay with his maternal uncles to honor them with that. The people began to speak to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about staying with them. Abu Ayyub al-Ansari rushed to his baggage and brought it into his house. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kept saying: 'A man is with his baggage.' And As'ad ibn Zurarah came and took the rein of his riding camel, and it remained with him. In the narration of Anas in Al-Bukhari, the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Which of our family's houses is nearest?' Abu Ayyub said: 'I am, O Messenger of Allah, this is my house, and this is my door.' He said: 'Then go and prepare a resting place for us.' He replied: 'Come, with the blessing of Allah.' After a few days, his wife Sawda, his two daughters Fatima and Umm Kulthum, Usama ibn Zayd, and Umm Ayman arrived. Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr left with them, bringing Abu Bakr's family, including Aisha. Zaynab remained with Abul-As, who did not allow her to leave until she migrated after Badr. Aisha said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal fell ill with fever. I entered upon them and said: 'O my father, how do you find yourself? And O Bilal, how do you find yourself?' She said: When the fever took Abu Bakr, he would say: A man finds the morning among his family, And death is nearer than the strap of his sandal. And when Bilal recovered, he would raise his voice and say: Alas, would that I knew if I would ever spend a night in a valley Surrounded by *idhkhir* and *jalil* grass * And would that I would one day reach the waters of Majannah, And would that Shamah and Tufail would appear to me. Aisha said: I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and informed him. He said: 'O Allah, make Medina beloved to us as we love Mecca, or even more. Make it healthy, and bless its *Sa'* and its *Mudd* (measures), and move its fever and place it in Al-Juhfa.' At this point, a segment of his life (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ended, and a phase of the Islamic Call was completed, which was the Meccan phase. Life in Medina: The Medinan era can be divided into three phases: 1. A phase in which unrest and discord were stirred up, and obstacles were erected from within, and enemies marched on Medina from without to uproot its greenery. This phase ends with the Truce of Al-Hudaybiyyah, in Dhul-Qa'dah of the 6th year of the Hijra. 2. The phase of truce with the pagan leadership, which ends with the Conquest of Mecca, in Ramadan of the eighth year of the Hijra. This is the phase of calling kings to Islam. 3. The phase of people entering the religion of Allah in droves. This is the phase of tribes and peoples flocking to Medina, and this phase extends until the end of the life of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Rabi' al-Awwal of the 11th year of the Hijra. - Construction of the Prophet's Mosque (An-Nabawi): The first step the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took after that was the establishment of the Prophet's Mosque. At the place where his she-camel knelt, he ordered the building of this mosque. He bought it from two orphaned boys who owned it, and he participated in its construction himself. He would carry the bricks and stones and say: O Allah, there is no life but the life of the Hereafter, So forgive the Ansar and the Muhajirun. And he would say: This burden is not the burden of Khaybar, This is more righteous and purer for our Lord. This increased the Companions' activity in the construction, to the extent that one of them said: If we sit while the Prophet works, That would be a misguided deed from us. In that location were the graves of the polytheists, ruins, palm trees, and a *Gharqad* tree. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered the graves of the polytheists to be dug up, the ruins leveled, and the palms and the tree to be cut down and arranged towards the *Qiblah* of the mosque (the direction of prayer), which was then towards Jerusalem. Its doorposts were made of stones, its walls were erected from mud bricks and mud, its roof was made of palm leaves, its pillars were tree trunks, and its floor was spread with sand and gravel. Three doors were made for it. Its length from the *Qiblah* to its rear was one hundred cubits, and the two sides were the same or less. Its foundation was about three cubits. He built houses adjacent to it, stone houses with mud bricks and roofs of palm leaves and trunks. These were the chambers of his wives (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). After the chambers were completed, he moved into them from the house of Abu Ayyub. The mosque was not only a place for performing prayers, but also a university where Muslims received the teachings and guidance of Islam, a forum where the various tribal elements, which had long been divided by the biases and wars of the pre-Islamic era, met and united, a base for managing all affairs and launching initiatives, and a parliament for holding advisory and executive councils. In addition to all this, it was a home where a large number of poor refugee *Muhajirun* resided, who had no home, wealth, family, or children there. In the early days of the Hijra, the call to prayer (*Adhan*) was instituted, the celestial melody that resonates in the horizons five times a day, making the entire world tremble. The story of Abdullah ibn Zayd ibn Abd Rabbih's dream regarding this is well-known, narrated by At-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, Ahmad, and Ibn Khuzaymah. Fraternization between the Muslims: Just as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) established the mosque, the center of gathering and unity, he undertook another act, one of the most magnificent recorded by history: the fraternization between the *Muhajirun* (Emigrants) and the *Ansar* (Helpers). Ibn al-Qayyim said: 'Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) established brotherhood between the Muhajirun and the Ansar, in the house of Anas ibn Malik. They were ninety men, half of them from the Muhajirun and half from the Ansar. He established brotherhood between them on the basis of sharing, and they would inherit from each other after death, to the exclusion of blood relatives, until the Battle of Badr. When Allah (Almighty and Majestic) revealed: {…but those of [blood] relation are more entitled to [inherit] than [others] in the decree of Allah…} [Al-Anfal: 75], the inheritance was revoked, but the bond of brotherhood remained.' It is also said that he established a second brotherhood between the Muhajirun themselves. But the first is more established, and the Muhajirun were self-sufficient with the brotherhood of Islam, the brotherhood of the home, and the kinship of lineage, unlike the Muhajirun with the Ansar (end quote). The meaning of this brotherhood, as Muhammad Al-Ghazali said, is that the tribalisms of the pre-Islamic era dissolve, and there is no zeal except for Islam, and that the differences of lineage, color, and homeland disappear, so that no one is advanced or lagged behind except by his moral worth and piety. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made this brotherhood an enforceable contract, not an empty word, and an action related to lives and wealth, not a greeting that tongues babble without effect. The feelings of altruism, consolation, and companionship were intertwined in this brotherhood, filling the new society with the most magnificent examples. Al-Bukhari reported that when they came to Medina, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) established brotherhood between Abdur-Rahman and Sa'd ibn Ar-Rabi'. Sa'd said to Abdur-Rahman: 'I am the wealthiest of the Ansar. Divide my wealth into two halves, and I have two wives. Look at the one who pleases you most, tell me her name, and I will divorce her, and when her waiting period is over, you may marry her.' He replied: 'May Allah bless you in your family and your wealth. Where is your market?' They directed him to the market of Banu Qaynuqa. He did not return until he had a surplus of dried cheese and butter. Then he continued to go out every morning. One day he came with a trace of yellowness (perfume). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked: 'What is this?' He said: 'I got married.' He asked: 'How much dowry did you give her?' He said: 'The weight of a date pit in gold.' It was reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Ansar said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 'Divide the palm trees between us and our brothers.' He said: 'No.' Then they said: 'Then you will spare us the labor and we will share the fruit with you.' They replied: 'We hear and we obey.' This shows us the extreme hospitality of the Ansar towards their brothers the Muhajirun, and their sacrifice, altruism, affection, and purity, and the appreciation of the Muhajirun for this generosity, not exploiting it and not taking from it except what was necessary for their sustenance. Truly, this fraternization was a singular wisdom, a sound and sagacious policy, and a wonderful solution to many of the problems facing the Muslims, which we have pointed out. The Battle of Badr (Al-Kubra): The First of the Decisive Battles of Islam We previously mentioned in the account of the Expedition of Al-Ushayrah that a caravan of Quraysh had escaped the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on its way from Mecca to Syria. When its return from Syria to Mecca approached, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent Talhah ibn Ubaydillah and Sa'id ibn Zayd north to scout for news of it. They reached Al-Hawra and remained there until Abu Sufyan passed by with the caravan. They hurried to Medina and informed the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) of the news. The caravan was loaded with immense wealth belonging to the people of Mecca, one thousand camels heavily laden with goods worth no less than fifty thousand gold dinars, and was guarded by only about forty men. It was a golden opportunity for the army of Medina, and a crippling military, political, and economic blow against the polytheists if they lost this immense wealth. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) announced to the Muslims: 'This is the caravan of Quraysh with their wealth. Go out to intercept it, perhaps Allah will grant it to you as spoils.' He did not compel anyone to go out, but left the matter to absolute willingness, because he did not expect at this mobilization that he would clash with the army of Mecca – instead of the caravan – in this violent confrontation at Badr. That is why many of the Companions remained in Medina, assuming that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)'s journey in this direction would not exceed what they were accustomed to in previous expeditions. Therefore, no one was rebuked for staying behind in this campaign. Strength of the Islamic Army and Distribution of Commands: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prepared to leave with three hundred and some ten men (313, 314, or 317 men), 82, 83, or 86 of the *Muhajirun*, 61 of the Aws, and 170 of the Khazraj. They did not celebrate this departure elaborately, nor did they take their full readiness. They had only two horses: one horse for Az-Zubayr ibn Al-Awwam and one horse for Al-Miqdad ibn Al-Aswad Al-Kindi. They had seventy camels, so that two or three men would take turns riding one camel. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Ali, and Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi took turns riding one camel. He left Ibn Umm Maktum as his deputy over Medina and for leading the prayer. When he was at Ar-Rawha, he sent back Abu Lubabah ibn Abd Al-Mundhir and appointed him as governor of Medina. He gave the banner of general command to Mus'ab ibn Umayr al-Qurashi al-Abdari. This banner was white. He divided his army into two battalions: 1. The *Muhajirun* battalion, whose standard he gave to Ali ibn Abi Talib. 2. The *Ansar* battalion, whose standard he gave to Sa'd ibn Mu'adh. He appointed Az-Zubayr ibn Al-Awwam to the command of the right flank, and Al-Miqdad ibn Amr to the command of the left flank – they were the only two horsemen in the army, as previously mentioned – and he appointed Qays ibn Abi Sa'sa' to the rearguard. The general command remained in his hand (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as the supreme commander of the army. The Islamic Army Moves Towards Badr: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) marched with this unprepared army. He left through the pass of Medina and proceeded on the main road leading to Mecca until he reached the well of Ar-Rawha. When he left there, he kept the Mecca road to his left, and turned right towards An-Naziyyah, intending for Badr. He traveled through a part of it until he cut across a valley called Rahqan, between An-Naziyyah and the narrow pass of As-Safra. Then he passed through the pass, and descended from it until he was close to As-Safra. There, he sent Basbas ibn Amr al-Juhani and Adiyy ibn Abi az-Zaghba al-Juhani to Badr to spy on the caravan's news for him. The Warning in Mecca: As for the news of the caravan, Abu Sufyan – who was in charge of it – was extremely cautious and vigilant. He knew that the Mecca road was fraught with dangers, and he was scouting for news, questioning everyone he met from the travelers. Soon, his intelligence reported to him that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had mobilized his companions to intercept the caravan. At that moment, Abu Sufyan hired Damdam ibn Amr al-Ghifari to go to Mecca, calling on Quraysh to mobilize to defend it against Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions. Damdam rushed out until he came to Mecca, shouting in the bottom of the valley, standing on his camel, whose nose he had split, whose saddle he had reversed, and whose shirt he had torn, saying: 'O company of Quraysh, the caravan! The caravan! Your wealth is with Abu Sufyan, Muhammad and his companions have intercepted it. I do not think you will catch up with it! Help! Help!' The Composition of the Meccan Army: The strength of this army was about one thousand three hundred fighters at the beginning of its march. It had one hundred horses, six hundred shields, and many camels, whose exact number is not known. Its general commander was Abu Jahl ibn Hisham. Nine men from the nobles of Quraysh were in charge of provisioning it, slaughtering nine camels one day and ten the next. The Caravan Escapes: As for the story of Abu Sufyan, he was traveling on the main road, but he remained cautious and vigilant, and he doubled his scouting activities. When he approached Badr, he advanced his caravan until he met Majdi ibn Amr and asked him about the army of Medina. He said: 'I have not seen anyone whom I would suspect, except that I saw two riders kneel down near this hill, then they drank from a waterskin they had, and then left.' Abu Sufyan rushed to their resting place, took some of the dung of their camels, and crumbled it. He found date pits in it. He said: 'By Allah, this is the fodder of Yathrib.' He quickly returned to his caravan, struck its face, turning its direction towards the coast to the west, leaving the main road that passes through Badr on the left. Thus, he saved the caravan from falling into the hands of the army of Medina. He sent his message to the Mecca army, which they received at Al-Juhfa. The First of the Decisive Battles of Islam The Critical Situation of the Islamic Army: As for the intelligence of the Medina army, it conveyed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – while he was still on the road in the valley of Dhakran – the news of the caravan and the mobilization. He became certain, after deliberation on those reports, that there was no room left to avoid a bloody encounter, and that there must be an advance based on courage, bravery, daring, and boldness. There was no doubt that if the Mecca army was allowed to wander through that region, it would strengthen Quraysh's military position, extend its political authority, and weaken the word of the Muslims and undermine it. Furthermore, the Islamic movement might remain thereafter a body without a soul, and everyone who harbored hatred or resentment against Islam in that region would dare to do evil. After all this, would there be anyone to guarantee to the Muslims that the Mecca army would be prevented from continuing its march towards Medina, moving the battle to its walls, and invading the Muslims in their own home? No, for any retreat by the Medina army would have the worst effect on the dignity and reputation of the Muslims. The Consultative Council: In view of this sudden and dangerous development, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) held a supreme consultative military council, in which he pointed out the current situation and exchanged opinions with his army in general and its commanders. At that time, the hearts of a group of people were shaken, and they feared the bloody encounter. These are the ones about whom Allah said: {Just as your Lord caused you to go out from your home with the truth, while indeed, a party of the believers were unwilling, * Arguing with you concerning the truth after it had become clear, as if they were being driven toward death while they were looking on.} [Al-Anfal: 5-6]. As for the army commanders, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq stood up, spoke, and spoke well. Then Umar ibn Al-Khattab stood up, spoke, and spoke well. Then Al-Miqdad ibn Amr stood up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, proceed as Allah has shown you, for we are with you. By Allah, we will not say to you what the Children of Israel said to Moses: 'Go, you and your Lord, and fight; indeed, we are remaining right here,' but rather: 'Go, you and your Lord, and fight; indeed, we are fighting with both of you.' By the One who sent you with the truth, if you marched with us to Bark al-Ghimad, we would fight with you before it until you reached it.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spoke kindly to him and prayed for him with good. These three commanders were from the *Muhajirun*, who were a minority in the army. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wished to know the opinion of the *Ansar* commanders, because they represented the majority of the army, and the burden of the battle would fall on their shoulders, especially since the terms of the Pledge of Al-Aqaba did not obligate them to fight outside their homeland. So, after hearing the words of these three commanders, he said: 'Advise me, O people,' meaning the Ansar. Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, the chief of the Ansar and their standard-bearer, understood this and said: '... By Allah, it is as if you mean us, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'We have believed in you, we have affirmed your truthfulness, and we have testified that what you brought is the truth, and we have given you our covenants and pledges of hearing and obeying. So, proceed with what you have decided, O Messenger of Allah. By the One who sent you with the truth, if you were to traverse this sea and wade into it, we would wade into it with you. Not a single man among us would stay behind. We do not dislike meeting our enemy tomorrow. We are enduring in war, truthful in the encounter. Perhaps Allah will show you from us what will please your eyes. So, march with us with the blessing of Allah.' In another narration, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 'Perhaps you fear that the Ansar consider it their duty not to support you except in their own homes. I speak for the Ansar and answer for them. Travel wherever you wish, establish ties with whomever you wish, cut ties with whomever you wish, take from our wealth whatever you wish, and give us whatever you wish. What you take from us is dearer to us than what you leave. And any matter you command, our command follows yours. By Allah, if you marched until you reached Al-Birk of Ghumdan, we would march with you. And by Allah, if you were to traverse this sea, we would wade into it with you.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was pleased with Sa'd's words and it invigorated him. Then he said: 'March on and be of good cheer, for Allah Almighty has promised me one of the two parties. By Allah, it is as if I am looking now at the places of death of the people.' The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Conducts a Reconnaissance Operation: There, he himself conducted a reconnaissance operation with his companion in the cave, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him). As they were touring around the Mecca camp, they came across an elderly Arab man. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him about Quraysh and about Muhammad and his companions – he asked about both armies for increased secrecy. But the old man said: 'I will not inform you until you inform me of who you are.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: 'If you inform us, we will inform you.' He said: 'Is it so?' He replied: 'Yes.' The old man said: 'It has reached me that Muhammad and his companions left on such-and-such a day, and if the one who informed me spoke the truth, they are today in such-and-such a place' – referring to the location of the Medina army. 'And it has reached me that Quraysh left on such-and-such a day, and if the one who informed me spoke the truth, they are today in such-and-such a place' – referring to the location of the Mecca army. When he finished his report, he asked: 'Who are you from?' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: 'We are from water.' Then he left him. The old man kept muttering: 'From water? From the water of Iraq?' The Descent of Rain: And Allah Almighty sent down a single rain that night. It was a severe downpour for the polytheists, preventing them from advancing, and it was a light drizzle for the Muslims, purifying them, removing from them the defilement of Satan, hardening the ground, firming up the sand, establishing their feet, smoothing the resting place, and strengthening their hearts. The Islamic Army Precedes to the Most Important Military Centers: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) moved with his army to precede the polytheists to the water of Badr, and prevent them from seizing it. He dismounted in the evening at the nearest water to Badr's wells. It was here that Al-Hubab ibn Al-Mundhir stood up as a military expert and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, do you see this position? Is it a position that Allah has caused you to occupy, which we are not permitted to advance beyond or retreat from? Or is it a matter of opinion, war, and deception?' He replied: 'Rather, it is a matter of opinion, war, and deception.' He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, this is not a suitable position. Move the people until we reach the nearest water to the people – Quraysh – we encamp there, and we destroy (i.e., fill in) the wells behind it. Then we build a basin over it and fill it with water. Then we fight the people, and we will drink, and they will not drink.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'You have given a wise opinion.' So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) moved with the army until he reached the water nearest to the enemy and encamped there for half the night. Then they made the basins and filled in all the other wells. Continuation of the Battle of Badr (Al-Kubra) The First of the Decisive Battles of Islam The Command Headquarters: After the Muslims had settled at the water, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh suggested to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that the Muslims should build a headquarters for his command in preparation for emergencies and in consideration of defeat before victory. He said: 'O Prophet of Allah, shall we not build for you a canopy (*arish*) where you may be, and we will prepare your riding camels near you? Then we will meet our enemy. If Allah honors us and grants us victory over our enemy, that will be what we love. And if the outcome is otherwise, you will sit on your riding camels and join those of our people who remained behind us. Indeed, some people stayed behind you, O Prophet of Allah, who do not love you less than us. If they had thought you would meet a war, they would not have stayed behind you. Allah will protect you by them, they will advise you sincerely and fight alongside you.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) praised him and prayed for him with good. The Muslims built a canopy on a raised hill located northeast of the battleground, overlooking the battlefield. Similarly, a squad of Ansar youth led by Sa'd ibn Mu'adh was chosen to guard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) around his command headquarters. Army Mobilization and Spending the Night: Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mobilized his army and walked on the battleground, pointing with his hand: 'This will be the place of death of so-and-so tomorrow, if Allah wills, and this will be the place of death of so-and-so tomorrow, if Allah wills.' Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spent the night praying by a tree trunk there. The Muslims spent their night in calm breaths, with bright horizons, confidence filled their hearts, and they took their share of rest, hoping to see the signs of their Lord in the morning: {When He overwhelmed you with slumber as a security from Him, and sent down upon you from the sky, water, that He might purify you thereby and remove from you the defilement of Satan and reinforce your hearts and make firm your feet thereby.} [Al-Anfal: 11]. This night was the night of Friday, the seventeenth of the month of Ramadan, in the second year of the Hijra, and his departure had been on the 8th or 12th of the same month. The Two Armies Face Each Other: When the polytheists appeared and the two groups came face to face, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'O Allah, here is Quraysh, who has come with its arrogance and pride, defying You and denying Your Messenger. O Allah, grant me the victory You promised me. O Allah, destroy them this morning.' And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, when he saw Utbah ibn Rabi'ah among the people on his red camel: 'If there is any good in any of the people, it is with the owner of the red camel. If they obey him, they will be rightly guided.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) straightened the ranks of the Muslims. While he was adjusting them, a strange incident occurred. He held a stick in his hand with which he was adjusting the ranks. Sawad ibn Ghaziyyah had stepped out of the line. The Prophet poked him in the stomach with the stick and said: 'Be straight, O Sawad.' Sawad said: 'O Messenger of Allah, you have hurt me, so grant me retaliation (*Qisas*).' He uncovered his stomach and said: 'Take your retaliation.' Sawad embraced him and kissed his stomach. He asked: 'What made you do this, O Sawad?' He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what you see is imminent, and I wanted my last contact with you to be my skin touching yours.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed for him with good. When the ranks were straightened, he gave his orders to his army not to start fighting until they received his final commands. Then he gave them a special instruction regarding the battle. He said: 'If they overwhelm you – meaning if they outnumber you – shoot at them but save your arrows. And do not draw your swords until they close in on you.' Then he returned to the canopy, accompanied only by Abu Bakr, and Sa'd ibn Mu'adh stood with the guard squad at the entrance of the canopy. As for the polytheists, Abu Jahl made an invocation that day, saying: 'O Allah, cut off the kinship from us and bring upon us what we do not know, then destroy him this morning. O Allah, whichever of us was more beloved to You and more pleasing to You, grant him victory today.' It was regarding this that Allah revealed: {If you [disbelievers] seek the victory [to be judged between us], the victory has come to you. And if you cease [your hostility], it will be better for you. But if you return [to battle], We will return [to assistance], and never will your force avail you aught, even if it was great, and [know] that Allah is with the believers.} [Al-Anfal: 19]. Zero Hour and the First Fuel of the Battle: The first one to fuel the battle was Al-Aswad ibn Abd Al-Asad Al-Makhzumi – a fierce man with bad character – who came out saying: 'I swear by Allah that I will drink from their basin, or I will destroy it, or I will die before it.' When he came out, Hamza ibn Abd Al-Muttalib (may Allah be pleased with him) came out to meet him. When they met, Hamza struck him and severed his foot with half of his leg, while he was short of the basin. He fell on his back, his leg spurting blood towards his companions. Then he crawled towards the basin until he plunged into it, wanting to fulfill his oath. But Hamza followed up with another blow that finished him off while he was inside the basin. The Duel (*Mubarazah*): And it was this first killing that ignited the fire of the battle. Following it, three of the best knights of Quraysh, who belonged to one family, came out: 'Utbah and his brother Shaybah, the sons of Rabi'ah, and Al-Walid bin 'Utbah. When they separated from the rank, they asked for a duel. Three young men from the Ansar came out to face them: 'Awf and Mu'awwadh, the sons of Al-Harith – whose mother was 'Afra – and 'Abdullah bin Rawahah. They asked them: “Who are you?” They replied: “A group from the Ansar.” They said: “Noble equals. We have no need of you; we only want our cousins.” Then their caller shouted: “O Muhammad, bring forth our equals from our own people!” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Stand up, O 'Ubaydah bin Al-Harith, stand up, O Hamzah, and stand up, O 'Ali.” When they stood up and approached them, [the Meccans] asked: “Who are you?” They informed them, and [the Meccans] said: “You are noble equals.” 'Ubaydah – who was the eldest of the group – challenged 'Utbah bin Rabi'ah, Hamzah challenged Shaybah, and 'Ali challenged Al-Walid. As for Hamzah and 'Ali, they did not give their opponents respite and killed them. As for 'Ubaydah, he and his opponent exchanged two blows, and each severely wounded the other. Then 'Ali and Hamzah rushed upon 'Utbah and killed him. They carried 'Ubaydah, whose leg had been severed. He remained silent until he died at As-Safra' four or five days after the Battle of Badr, while the Muslims were on their way to Medina. 'Ali swore by Allah that these verses were revealed concerning them: “These are two adversaries who have disputed about their Lord.” [Al-Hajj: 19]. The General Assault: The end of this duel was a bad start for the polytheists. They lost three of their finest knights and leaders all at once. They were filled with rage and rushed upon the Muslims as one man. As for the Muslims, after seeking victory and succor from their Lord, being sincere to Him, and supplicating before Him, they received the successive attacks of the polytheists, holding fast to their positions, adopting a defensive stance. They inflicted heavy losses upon the polytheists, all the while saying: “One! One!” (Allah is Unique). The Messenger (PBUH) Appeals to His Lord: As for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), ever since he returned after adjusting the ranks, he had been appealing to his Lord for the promised victory, saying: “O Allah, fulfill Your promise to me! O Allah, I beseech You by Your covenant and Your promise!” When the heat of the battle intensified, and the grinding of war turned severely, and the fighting raged, reaching its peak, he said: “O Allah, if this small band perishes today, You will not be worshipped. O Allah, if You will, You will never be worshipped after this day.” He overdid his earnest supplication until his mantle fell from his shoulders. As-Siddiq (Abu Bakr) put it back on him and said: “Enough for you, O Messenger of Allah, you have pleaded enough with your Lord.” Allah revealed to His angels: “Indeed, I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved.” [Al-Anfal: 12] And He revealed to His Messenger: “I will reinforce you with a thousand of the angels in succession.” [Al-Anfal: 9] Meaning, they are following you closely, or they follow one another in successive waves, not all coming at once. The Descent of the Angels: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) dozed off for a moment, then raised his head and said: “Rejoice, O Abu Bakr, this is Jibril with the dust on his front teeth (i.e., the dust of the road).” In a narration by Muhammad bin Ishaq, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Rejoice, O Abu Bakr, the victory of Allah has come to you. This is Jibril, holding the rein of his horse and leading it, with dust on his front teeth.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out from the door of the canopy, leaping in his armor and reciting: “The host will be routed, and they will turn their backs (in flight).” [Al-Qamar: 45] Then he took a handful of pebbles, faced Quraysh with them, and said: “May these faces be disgraced!” (Shahat al-Wujuh) and threw them into their faces. There was no one among the polytheists who was not hit in his eye, nostrils, and mouth by that handful. Concerning this, Allah revealed: “And you did not throw when you threw, but it was Allah who threw.” [Al-Anfal: 17]. Continuation of the Great Battle of Badr The First Decisive Battle of Islam Iblis Withdraws from the Battlefield: When Iblis – who had come in the form of Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum Al-Mudliji, as mentioned, and had not left them since that time – saw what the angels were doing to the polytheists, he fled and retreated on his heels. Al-Harith bin Hisham – thinking he was Suraqah – clung to him. [Iblis] jabbed Al-Harith in the chest and threw him down, then ran away. The polytheists asked him: “Where are you going, Suraqah? Did you not say that you were our protector and would not leave us?” He replied: “Indeed, I see what you do not see. I fear Allah, and Allah is severe in punishment.” Then he fled until he threw himself into the sea. The Crushing Defeat: The signs of failure and disorder began to appear in the ranks of the polytheists. Their lines began to crumble before the fierce attacks of the Muslims. The battle neared its end, and the multitudes of polytheists began to flee and withdraw in disarray. The Muslims rode on their backs, capturing and killing until the defeat was complete. The Steadfastness of Abu Jahl: As for the greatest tyrant, Abu Jahl, when he saw the first signs of disorder in his ranks, he tried to stand firm against this flood. He began to encourage his army, saying to them fiercely and arrogantly: “Do not be defeated by Suraqah’s abandonment of you, for he had an agreement with Muhammad. And do not be terrified by the killing of 'Utbah, Shaybah, and Al-Walid, for they were hasty. By Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza, we will not return until we have them bound with ropes! And let no man among you kill one of them, but take them captive until we make them realize the evil of their deeds.” However, the reality of this arrogance soon became apparent to him. It was not long before the ranks began to crack under the currents of the Muslim attack. Yes, a band of polytheists remained around him, forming a fence of swords and thickets of spears around him, but the storm of the Muslim attack dispersed this fence and uprooted these thickets. It was then that this tyrant appeared, and the Muslims saw him roaming on his horse. Death was waiting to drink his blood at the hands of two young men from the Ansar. The Death of Abu Jahl: 'Abd Ar-Rahman bin 'Awf said: “I was in the rank on the Day of Badr when I turned and saw on my right and left two young men who were newly adult. I was somewhat uneasy about their presence, when one of them whispered to me, away from his companion: ‘Uncle, show me Abu Jahl.’ I asked: ‘My nephew, what would you do with him?’ He said: ‘I was informed that he insults the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ He said: ‘By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if I see him, my person will not leave his person until the sooner of us dies.’ I was astonished by this.” He added: “The other one nudged me and said the same thing to me. It was not long before I looked and saw Abu Jahl roaming among the people. I said: ‘Do you not see? This is your man you were asking me about.’ He said: “They rushed at him with their swords and struck him until they killed him. Then they returned to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who asked: ‘Which of you killed him?’ Each of them said: ‘I killed him.’ [The Prophet] asked: ‘Have you wiped your swords?’ They said: ‘No.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked at the two swords and said: ‘Both of you killed him,’ and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) decreed his spoils to Mu'adh bin 'Amr bin Al-Jamuh. The two men were Mu'adh bin 'Amr bin Al-Jamuh and Mu'adh bin 'Afra.” Ibn Ishaq reported that Mu'adh bin 'Amr bin Al-Jamuh said: “I heard the people, while Abu Jahl was in a dense formation like a thicket (Al-Harajah is a dense tree, or an inaccessible tree; he compared the spears and swords of the polytheists around Abu Jahl for his protection to this tree), saying: ‘Abu Al-Hakam cannot be reached.’” He said: “When I heard that, I made him my concern and headed towards him. When I could reach him, I charged him and struck him a blow that made his foot fly off – cutting it off mid-leg. By Allah, when it flew off, I only likened it to a date pit flying out from under a date-pit pounder when it is struck.” He added: “His son 'Ikrimah struck me on my shoulder, cutting off my hand, which was left hanging by a strip of skin next to my flank. The fighting distracted me from him, and I fought most of my day dragging it behind me. When it bothered me, I put my foot on it, then pulled at it until I threw it off.” Then Mu'awwadh bin 'Afra passed by Abu Jahl – who was severely wounded – and struck him until he finished him off, leaving him with his last breath. Mu'awwadh fought until he was killed. When the battle was over, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked: “Who will look for what Abu Jahl has done?” People dispersed in search of him. 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) found him taking his last breath. He placed his foot on his neck and took hold of his beard to cut off his head, and said: “Has Allah disgraced you, O enemy of Allah?” He replied: “And how has He disgraced me? What is worse than a man you have killed? Is there anything beyond a man you have killed?” He added: “If only a non-farmer had killed me!” Then he asked: “Tell me, to whom is the turnover today?” He replied: “To Allah and His Messenger.” Then he said to Ibn Mas'ud – who had his foot on his neck –: “You have climbed a difficult height, O little shepherd of goats!” (Ibn Mas'ud was one of the goat herders in Mecca). After this exchange, Ibn Mas'ud cut off his head and brought it to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, this is the head of Allah's enemy, Abu Jahl!” He asked: “Allah, besides whom there is no deity?” He repeated it three times, then said: “Allah is the Greatest! Praise be to Allah Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant, and defeated the confederates alone! Go, show him to me.” We went, and I showed him to him. He said: “This is the Pharaoh of this Ummah.” That day, 'Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) killed his maternal uncle, Al-'As bin Hisham bin Al-Mughirah. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) called out to his son 'Abd Ar-Rahman – who was with the polytheists at the time – and said: “Where is my property, O wicked one?” 'Abd Ar-Rahman replied: “It was the first calamity that Allah inflicted upon the people of polytheism. Inflicting heavy losses by killing the people of polytheism was dearer to me than preserving the men.” The battle ended with a crushing defeat for the polytheists and a clear victory for the Muslims. Fourteen men among the Muslims were martyred in this battle, six from the Muhajiroun and eight from the Ansar. As for the polytheists, they suffered heavy losses: seventy killed and seventy captured. Most of them were leaders, chiefs, and champions. When the war was over, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and stood over the killed and said: “What a bad tribe you were to your Prophet! You disbelieved me, while the people believed me; you abandoned me, while the people helped me; you drove me out, while the people gave me refuge.” Then he ordered them to be dragged to a well (Qalīb) in Badr. Mecca Receives the News of the Defeat: The polytheists fled from the field of Badr in a disorganized manner. They scattered in the valleys and ravines and headed towards Mecca, terrified, not knowing how to enter it out of shame. Ibn Ishaq said that the first to arrive with the news of Quraysh’s disaster was Al-Haysuman bin 'Abdullah Al-Khuza'i. They asked: “What is behind you?” He replied: “'Utbah bin Rabi'ah, Shaybah bin Rabi'ah, Abu Al-Hakam bin Hisham, and Umayyah bin Khalaf were killed, along with other leaders whom he named.” As he began to count the nobles of Quraysh, Safwan bin Umayyah, who was sitting in the sanctuary (Al-Hijr), said: “By Allah, this man is not sensible. Ask him about me.” They asked: “What happened to Safwan bin Umayyah?” He replied: “He is sitting right there in the sanctuary. By Allah, I saw his father and his brother being killed.” Abu Rafi' – the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – said: “I was a slave of Al-'Abbas, and Islam had entered our household. Al-'Abbas converted to Islam, Umm Al-Fadl converted, and I converted. Al-'Abbas kept his Islam a secret. Abu Lahab had stayed behind from Badr. When the news reached him, Allah afflicted him with grief and humiliation. We felt strength and pride within ourselves. I was a weak man who made cups, carving them in the chamber of Zamzam. By Allah, I was sitting there carving my cups, and Umm Al-Fadl was sitting beside me. We were overjoyed by the news that reached us, when Abu Lahab approached, dragging his feet with evil, and sat by the rope of the chamber, his back to mine. While he was sitting, the people said: ‘This is Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin 'Abd Al-Muttalib who has arrived.’ Abu Lahab said to him: ‘Come here! By my life, you have the news!’” He said: “He sat with him, and the people were standing around them. [Abu Lahab] asked: ‘O my nephew, tell me what happened to the people.’ He replied: ‘As soon as we met the enemy, we turned our backs to them. They were killing us as they wished and capturing us as they wished.’ He added: ‘By Allah, despite that, I do not blame the people. We met white men on dappled horses between the sky and the earth. By Allah, they spared nothing, and nothing could stand against them.’ ” Abu Rafi' said: “I lifted the rope of the chamber with my hand and then said: ‘By Allah, those were the angels!’ Abu Lahab raised his hand and struck my face a severe blow. I wrestled with him, but he lifted me up, threw me to the ground, and then knelt on me, beating me. I was a weak man. Umm Al-Fadl stood up, took a pillar of the chamber, and struck him with it, inflicting a nasty wound on his head. She said: ‘You overpower him because his master is absent!’ He stood up, turning away in humiliation. By Allah, he lived only seven nights until Allah afflicted him with Al-'Adasah (a plague-like sore which the Arabs considered a bad omen) and it killed him. His sons abandoned him, and he remained for three days without anyone approaching his corpse or attempting to bury him. When they feared the disgrace of leaving him, they dug a pit for him, then pushed him into his grave with a stick, and pelted him with stones from a distance until they covered him up. The Jews and the hypocrites had spread alarm in Medina by circulating false rumors, even spreading the news of the killing of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When one of the hypocrites saw Zayd bin Harithah riding Al-Qaswa' – the she-camel of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – he said: “Muhammad has been killed, and this is his she-camel that we recognize, and this Zayd is so terrified he doesn't know what he is saying, and he came back alone.” When the two messengers arrived, the Muslims surrounded them and began to hear the news from them until the Muslims’ victory was confirmed. Joy and happiness spread, and the city resonated with Tahlil (saying 'La ilaha illa Allah') and Takbir (saying 'Allahu Akbar'). The leaders of the Muslims – who were in Medina – headed towards the road to Badr to congratulate the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on this clear victory. Usamah bin Zayd said: “The news reached us when we were covering Ruqayyah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), with earth. She was the wife of 'Uthman bin 'Affan. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had left me with 'Uthman to look after her.” __________________ The Issue of the Prisoners: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reached Medina, he consulted his companions about the prisoners. Abu Bakr said: “O Messenger of Allah, these are our cousins, our tribe, and our brothers. I suggest that you take ransom from them. What we take will be a source of strength for us against the disbelievers, and perhaps Allah will guide them, and they will become a support for us.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked: “What is your opinion, O Ibn Al-Khattab?” 'Umar said: “By Allah, I do not agree with Abu Bakr’s opinion. Rather, I think you should allow me to execute so-and-so – a relative of 'Umar – by striking his neck, and allow 'Ali to strike the neck of 'Aqil bin Abi Talib, and allow Hamzah to strike the neck of his brother so-and-so, so that Allah may know that there is no leniency in our hearts for the polytheists, and these are their champions, their leaders, and their commanders.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) preferred what Abu Bakr said and did not agree with what I said. He took ransom from them. The next day, 'Umar said: “I went to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr, and they were weeping. I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, tell me what makes you and your companion weep. If I find a reason to weep, I will weep, and if I do not find a reason, I will pretend to weep for your weeping.’ ” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is because of what your companions presented to me concerning taking the ransom. Their punishment was shown to me, closer than this tree – a nearby tree.” And Allah, the Almighty, revealed: “It is not for a Prophet to have captives until he has inflicted a great slaughter in the land. You desire the transient goods of this world, whereas Allah desires the Hereafter. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. Had it not been for a prior decree from Allah, there would have touched you, for what you took, a great punishment.” [Al-Anfal: 67-68]. The matter was settled according to the opinion of As-Siddiq, and he took ransom from them. The ransom ranged from four thousand dirhams to three thousand dirhams, down to one thousand dirhams. The people of Mecca could write, but the people of Medina could not. Whoever did not have a ransom was entrusted with ten boys from the boys of Medina to teach. When they became proficient, that would be his ransom. [The Prophet] granted a favor to his son-in-law, Abu Al-'As, on the condition that he would release Zaynab. She had sent money for his ransom, which included a necklace that belonged to Khadijah and which she had given to him when she married her to Abu Al-'As. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw it, he felt deep compassion for her and asked his companions for permission to release Abu Al-'As, which they did. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stipulated to Abu Al-'As that he should release Zaynab, and he did. She emigrated, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent Zayd bin Harithah and a man from the Ansar, saying: “Wait in the valley of Ya'jaj until Zaynab passes by, and then accompany her.” They went out and returned with her. The story of her emigration is long and painful. Among the prisoners was Suhayl bin 'Amr, who was an eloquent orator. 'Umar said: “O Messenger of Allah, pull out the two front teeth of Suhayl bin 'Amr so that his tongue hangs out, and he will never be able to deliver a speech against you in any gathering.” However, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) refused this request, cautioning against mutilation and the retribution of Allah on the Day of Resurrection. In the second year of the Hijra, the fasting of Ramadan was made obligatory, as was Zakat Al-Fitr (charity of fast-breaking), and the shares of the other forms of Zakat were specified. The obligation of Zakat Al-Fitr and the detail of the other Zakat shares brought relief to many of the immigrant refugees who were poor and unable to travel and work the land. Among the best occasions and most marvelous coincidences was that the first 'Eid (festival) the Muslims celebrated in their lives was the 'Eid that occurred in Shawwal in the year 2 AH, following the clear victory they had achieved in the Battle of Badr. How splendid was this happy 'Eid that Allah brought them after crowning their heads with the diadem of victory and glory! And how magnificent was the sight of that prayer they performed after leaving their homes, raising their voices with Takbir (saying 'Allahu Akbar'), Tawhid (affirming the Oneness of Allah), and Tahmid (saying 'Alhamdulillah'), their hearts overflowing with yearning for Allah and longing for His mercy and satisfaction, after the favors He had bestowed upon them and the victory with which He had supported them, reminding them by saying: “And remember when you were few and oppressed in the land, fearing that people might abduct you, but He sheltered you and supported you with His victory and provided you with good things, that you might be grateful.” [Al-Anfal: 26] Battle of Uhud Quraysh Prepares for a Vengeful Battle: Mecca was burning with rage against the Muslims because of the tragedy of defeat and the killing of the champions and nobles it had suffered in the Battle of Badr. The desire for revenge and retaliation was surging within it, so much so that Quraysh had even forbidden weeping for their dead in Badr and prevented the hasty ransoming of prisoners so that the Muslims would not realize the extent of their tragedy and grief. Following the Battle of Badr, Quraysh agreed to wage a total war against the Muslims to quench its rage and satisfy its thirst for hatred. It began preparations to engage in such a battle. 'Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl, Safwan bin Umayyah, Abu Sufyan bin Harb, and 'Abdullah bin Rabi'ah were the most active and enthusiastic leaders of Quraysh in pursuing the battle. The first thing they did in this regard was to confiscate the caravan that Abu Sufyan had managed to save and which had been the cause of the Battle of Badr. They said to those whose property was in the caravan: “O people of Quraysh, Muhammad has victimized you and killed your best men. Help us with this wealth to fight him, so that we may perhaps take our revenge from him.” They agreed to this, and the caravan was sold. It contained a thousand camels, and the wealth was fifty thousand dinars. Concerning this, Allah, the Almighty, revealed: “Indeed, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to hinder [people] from the way of Allah. They will spend it; then it will be for them a source of regret; then they will be overcome.” [Al-Anfal: 36]. Then they opened the door to volunteering for all who wished to participate in the invasion of the Muslims, from the Ahabish, Kinanah, and the people of Tihamah. They employed various methods of incitement. Safwan bin Umayyah incited Abu 'Izzah the poet – who had been captured at Badr and whom the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had granted favor and released without ransom, taking a pledge from him not to rise against him – to incite the tribes against the Muslims. He promised him that if he returned alive from the raid, he would enrich him, and if not, he would take care of his daughters. Abu 'Izzah proceeded to incite the tribes with his poems, which inflamed their grudges. They also chose another poet – Musafi' bin 'Abd Manaf Al-Jumahi – for the same task. Abu Sufyan was the most fervent inciter against the Muslims after returning disappointed from the Expedition of As-Suwayq, having failed to achieve his goal and having lost a large amount of his supplies in that expedition. What further complicated the matter – or fueled the fire – was the heavy loss that Quraysh had recently suffered in the expedition of Zayd bin Harithah, which broke the back of their economy and caused them immeasurable grief and anxiety. At that point, Quraysh accelerated its preparations to engage in a decisive battle against the Muslims. Composition and Command of the Quraysh Army: By the turn of the year, Mecca had completed its preparations. Three thousand polytheist fighters from Quraysh, its allies, and the Ahabish had gathered. The leaders of Quraysh decided to take their women with them so that it would be a greater incentive for the men to fight to the death to protect their honor and chastity. The number of these women was fifteen. The transport equipment for this army consisted of three thousand camels, and the cavalry consisted of two hundred horses, which they led alongside them for the entire journey. The protective gear included seven hundred suits of armor. The overall command was given to Abu Sufyan bin Harb, and the command of the cavalry to Khalid bin Al-Walid, assisted by 'Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl. The banner was entrusted to Banu 'Abd Ad-Dar. Mecca's Army Marches: After this complete preparation, the Meccan army marched towards Medina. The old blood feuds and the hidden rage were kindling hatred in hearts, revealing the bitterness of the coming fight. Prophetic Intelligence Uncovers the Enemy's Movement: Al-'Abbas bin 'Abd Al-Muttalib was monitoring the movements and military preparations of Quraysh. When this army set out, Al-'Abbas sent an urgent message to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) containing all the details of the army. Al-'Abbas's messenger hastened to deliver the message, traveling with determination, so much so that he covered the distance between Mecca and Medina – which is about five hundred kilometers – in three days. He delivered the message to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) while he was at the Quba Mosque. Ubayy bin Ka'b read the letter to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who ordered him to keep it secret. [The Prophet] quickly returned to Medina and exchanged views with the leaders of the Muhajiroun and the Ansar. Muslim Preparation for Emergencies: Medina remained in a state of general alert. The men did not part with their weapons, even during prayer, in anticipation of emergencies. A detachment of the Ansar – including Sa'd bin Mu'adh, Usayd bin Hudayr, and Sa'd bin 'Ubadah – was assigned to guard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). They spent the night at his door, armed. Detachments were stationed at the entrances and defiles of Medina to guard it, fearing that they might be taken by surprise. Muslim patrols – to discover the enemy's movements – roamed around the routes that the polytheists were likely to take to raid the Muslims. The Meccan Army Reaches Medina's Walls: The Meccan army continued its march on the usual main western road. When it reached Al-Abwa', Hind bint 'Utbah – the wife of Abu Sufyan – suggested digging up the grave of the Messenger of Allah's mother (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). However, the army commanders rejected this request and warned against the dire consequences that would befall them if they opened this door. Then the Meccan army continued its march until it approached Medina. It took the valley of Al-'Aqiq, then turned right until it camped near Mount Uhud in a place called 'Aynayn, in the salty bed of Qanat on the edge of the valley – which is north of Medina – and encamped there on Friday, the sixth of the month of Shawwal, in the third year of the Hijra. Continuation of the Battle of Uhud Organization of the Islamic Army and Departure to the Battlefield: Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led the people in the Friday prayer. He exhorted them and commanded them to be diligent and hardworking. He informed them that victory would be theirs through their patience and ordered them to prepare for their enemy. The people were pleased with this. Then he led the people in the 'Asr (afternoon) prayer. They had gathered, and the people of Al-'Awali were present. Then he entered his house with his two companions, Abu Bakr and 'Umar. They helped him put on his turban and clothing. He fully armed himself, wearing a double coat of mail (i.e., wearing one armor over another) and strapping on his sword. Then he came out to the people. The people were waiting for his departure. Sa'd bin Mu'adh and Usayd bin Hudayr had told them: “Have you compelled the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to go out? Refer the matter back to him.” They all regretted what they had done. When he came out, they said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, it was not for us to disobey you. Do as you wish. If you prefer to stay in Medina, then do so.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not fitting for a Prophet, once he has put on his defensive gear (Lammatuhu – which is the armor), to take it off until Allah judges between him and his enemy.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) divided his army into three battalions: 1. The Battalion of the Muhajiroun (Emigrants). He gave its banner to Mus'ab bin 'Umayr Al-'Abdari. 2. The Battalion of the Aws (from the Ansar). He gave its banner to Usayd bin Hudayr. 3. The Battalion of the Khazraj (from the Ansar). He gave its banner to Al-Hubab bin Al-Mundhir. The army consisted of a thousand fighters, including a hundred in armor and fifty cavalrymen, although some said there were no cavalrymen. He appointed Ibn Umm Maktum to lead the prayer in Medina for those who remained there. The command to depart was given, and the army moved north. The two Sa'd (Sa'd bin Mu'adh and Sa'd bin 'Ubadah) ran ahead of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), both in armor. When he passed the pass of Ath-Thaniyyat Al-Wada', he saw a well-armed battalion separated from the main body of the army. He asked who they were. He was told they were Jews, allies of the Khazraj, who wished to participate in the fighting against the polytheists. He asked if they had embraced Islam. They replied: “No.” He refused to use the help of the people of disbelief against the people of polytheism. Reviewing the Army: When he reached a place called Ash-Shaykhan, he reviewed his army and sent back those he deemed too young or unable to fight. Among them were 'Abdullah bin 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, Usamah bin Zayd, Usayd bin Zuhayr, Zayd bin Thabit, Zayd bin Arqam, 'Arabah bin Aws, 'Amr bin Hazm, Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, Zayd bin Harithah Al-Ansari, and Sa'd bin Habbah. Al-Bara' bin 'Azib is mentioned among them, but his narration in Al-Bukhari indicates that he witnessed the fighting that day. He allowed Rafi' bin Khadij and Samurah bin Jundub to stay despite their young age. Rafi' bin Khadij was skilled in archery, so he permitted him. Samurah said: “I am stronger than Rafi', I can wrestle him down.” When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was informed of this, he ordered them to wrestle in front of him. They wrestled, and Samurah wrestled Rafi' down, so he also permitted him to stay. Spending the Night between Uhud and Medina: At this location, evening overtook them. He prayed the Maghrib prayer, then the Isha prayer, and spent the night there. He selected fifty men to guard the camp, patrolling around it. Their leader was Muhammad bin Maslamah Al-Ansari, the hero of the expedition of Ka'b bin Al-Ashraf. Dhakwan bin 'Abd Qays took on the special task of guarding the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Mutiny of 'Abdullah bin Ubayy and his Companions: A little before dawn, he set out and reached Ash-Shawth for the Fajr prayer. He was close to the enemy; he could see them, and they could see him. It was there that 'Abdullah bin Ubayy, the hypocrite, mutinied and withdrew with about a third of the army – three hundred fighters – saying: “We do not know why we should kill ourselves!” He outwardly protested that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had abandoned his opinion and obeyed others. Undoubtedly, the reason for this isolation was not the Prophet's rejection of this hypocrite's opinion, otherwise, his marching with the Prophet's army to this location would have had no meaning. If that had been the reason, he would have isolated himself from the army from the beginning of the march. Rather, his primary goal in this mutiny – at that critical moment – was to cause confusion and disorder in the Muslim army, in the sight and hearing of their enemy. This was so that the majority of the army would abandon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the morale of those who remained with him would collapse, while the enemy would be encouraged, and their determination would increase upon seeing this sight. This would hasten the elimination of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his sincere companions, thus clearing the way for the return of authority to this hypocrite and his followers. The hypocrite nearly succeeded in achieving some of his goals. Two factions – Banu Harithah from the Aws and Banu Salamah from the Khazraj – were about to waver, but Allah took them under His protection, and they stood firm after anxiety spread among them and they almost retreated and withdrew. Concerning them, Allah, the Almighty, says: “When two parties among you intended to lose heart, but Allah was their Protector. And upon Allah let the believers rely.” [Al-Imran: 122]. 'Abdullah bin Haram – the father of Jabir bin 'Abdullah – tried to remind these hypocrites of their duty in this critical situation. He followed them, rebuking them and urging them to return, saying: “Come and fight in the way of Allah or defend!” They replied: “If we knew there would be a fight, we would have followed you.” 'Abdullah bin Haram returned from them saying: “May Allah keep you away, O enemies of Allah! Allah will suffice His Prophet without you.” Concerning these hypocrites, Allah, the Almighty, says: “And that He might make evident those who are hypocrites, to whom it was said, 'Come, fight in the way of Allah or [at least] repel [the enemy].' They said, 'If we had known [there would be] fighting, we would have followed you.' They were that day nearer to disbelief than to faith. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts. And Allah is most knowing of what they conceal.” [Al-Imran: 167] Continuation of the Battle of Uhud The Defense Plan: There, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) organized his army and prepared them in ranks for battle. He selected a detachment of fifty skilled archers, and entrusted their command to 'Abdullah bin Jubayr bin An-Nu'man Al-Ansari Al-Awsi Al-Badri. He ordered them to be stationed on a hill located on the southern bank of the Wadi Qanat – which later became known as the Mount of the Archers (Jabal Ar-Rumat) – southeast of the Muslim camp, about one hundred and fifty meters from the headquarters of the Islamic army. The purpose of this was what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made clear in his words to these archers. He said to their commander: “Ward off the cavalry from us with arrows, so they do not come at us from behind. Whether the battle is for us or against us, remain firm in your position; let us not be attacked from your side.” Then he said to the archers: “Protect our backs. If you see us being killed, do not come to our aid. And if you see us taking spoils, do not join us in taking them.” In Al-Bukhari's narration, he said: “If you see us being snatched by the birds, do not leave your place until I send for you. And if you see us defeating the people and overrunning them, do not leave until I send for you.” By assigning this detachment to the hill with these strict military orders, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sealed the only breach through which the polytheist cavalry could have infiltrated the ranks of the Muslims, executed flanking maneuvers, and an encircling operation. As for the rest of the army, he placed Al-Mundhir bin 'Amr on the right flank and Az-Zubayr bin Al-'Awwam on the left flank, supported by Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad. Az-Zubayr had the task of standing firm against the cavalry of Khalid bin Al-Walid. He placed at the front of the ranks an excellent elite of brave Muslims and men renowned for their valor and bravery, whose value was equal to thousands. It was a very wise and precise plan, reflecting the genius of the Prophet's military leadership (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – and that no commander, no matter how advanced his competence, could have devised a plan more precise and wiser than this. He occupied the best position on the battlefield, even though he arrived there after the enemy. He protected his back and his right side with the mountain's heights, and protected his left side and his back – when the fighting raged – by sealing the only breach that existed on the side of the Islamic army. He chose an elevated position for his camp, which he could retreat to – if defeat befell the Muslims – and not resort to flight, which would expose him to falling into the hands of the pursuing enemies and being captured. He would also inflict heavy losses on his enemies if they wished to occupy his camp and advanced towards it. He forced his enemies to accept a low position, which would make it very difficult for them to gain any benefits of victory if they were to dominate, and difficult for them to escape the pursuing Muslims if the domination was with the Muslims. He also compensated for the numerical shortage of his men by selecting an excellent elite of outstanding brave companions. Thus, the Prophet's army was mobilized on the morning of Saturday, the seventh of the month of Shawwal, in the 3rd year of the Hijra. The Messenger (PBUH) Instills the Spirit of Valor in the Army: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the people from engaging in combat until he ordered them. He wore a double coat of mail and exhorted his companions to fight, encouraging them to persevere and show bravery upon the encounter. He began to instill the spirit of enthusiasm and valor in his companions – to the extent that he brandished a sharp sword and called out to his companions: “Who will take this sword with its due right?” Men rose to take it – among them 'Ali bin Abi Talib, Az-Zubayr bin Al-'Awwam, and 'Umar bin Al-Khattab – until Abu Dujanah Simak bin Kharashah stood up and asked: “And what is its due right, O Messenger of Allah?” He replied: “That you strike the faces of the enemy with it until it bends.” He said: “I will take it with its due right, O Messenger of Allah.” So he gave it to him. Abu Dujanah was a brave man who walked with arrogance during war. He had a red headband, and when he wore it, people knew he would fight to the death. When he took the sword, he wrapped his head with that headband and began to stride proudly between the ranks. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then said: “That is a walk which Allah detests, except in a situation like this.” The First Fuel of the Battle: The two armies approached, and the two factions drew near. The stages of fighting began. The first to fuel the battle was the standard-bearer of the polytheists, Talhah bin Abi Talhah Al-'Abdari. He was one of the bravest knights of Quraysh. The Muslims called him the ram of the battalion. He came out riding a camel, calling for a duel. People held back from him because of his extreme bravery. But Az-Zubayr advanced towards him and gave him no respite, leaping upon him like a lion until he was with him on his camel. Then he pushed him to the ground, threw him off, and slaughtered him with his sword. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw this magnificent struggle, pronounced the Takbir (Allahu Akbar), and the Muslims did the same. He praised Az-Zubayr and said concerning him: “Every Prophet has a disciple (Hawari), and the disciple (Hawari) is Az-Zubayr.” The Weight of the Battle Around the Banner and the Annihilation of its Bearers: Then the fires of the battle erupted, and the fighting intensified between the two sides at every point on the field. The weight of the battle revolved around the banner of the polytheists. The Banu 'Abd Ad-Dar took turns carrying the banner after their leader, Talhah bin Abi Talhah, was killed. His brother, Abu Shaybah 'Uthman bin Abi Talhah, carried it and advanced to fight, saying: “There is a duty upon the bearers of the banner To dye the spear-shaft with blood or to shatter it.” Hamzah bin 'Abd Al-Muttalib charged him and struck him on his shoulder with a blow that severed his hand along with his shoulder, reaching his navel, and exposing his lung. Then Abu Sa'd bin Abi Talhah raised the banner. Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas shot him with an arrow that hit his throat, making his tongue hang out. He died instantly. It is also said that Abu Sa'd came out calling for a duel. 'Ali bin Abi Talib advanced to him. They exchanged two blows, and 'Ali struck him and killed him. Then Musafi' bin Talhah bin Abi Talhah raised the banner. 'Asim bin Thabit bin Abi Al-Aflah shot him with an arrow and killed him. His brother Kullab bin Talhah bin Abi Talhah then carried the banner. Az-Zubayr bin Al-'Awwam swooped down on him and fought him until he killed him. Then their brother Al-Jallas bin Talhah bin Abi Talhah carried the banner. Talhah bin 'Ubaydullah stabbed him with a thrust that ended his life. It is also said that 'Asim bin Thabit bin Abi Al-Aflah shot him with an arrow and finished him off. These were six men from one house, the house of Abu Talhah 'Abdullah bin 'Uthman bin 'Abd Ad-Dar, all killed around the banner of the polytheists. Then Arta'ah bin Shurahbil from Banu 'Abd Ad-Dar carried it. 'Ali bin Abi Talib killed him. It is also said: Hamzah bin 'Abd Al-Muttalib. Then Shurayh bin Qarizh carried it. Quzman killed him – he was a hypocrite who fought with the Muslims out of tribal zeal, not for Islam. Then Abu Zayd 'Amr bin 'Abd Manaf Al-'Abdari carried it. Quzman also killed him. Then a son of Shurahbil bin Hashim Al-'Abdari carried it. Quzman also killed him. These were ten men from Banu 'Abd Ad-Dar – the bearers of the banner – who were annihilated to the last man. There was no one left to carry the banner. Then a young Abyssinian slave of theirs – named Sawab – came forward, carried the banner, and displayed a variety of bravery and steadfastness that surpassed his masters, the banner bearers who were killed before him. He fought until both his hands were cut off. He lay down on the banner with his chest and neck so that it would not fall until he was killed, saying: “O Allah, have I fulfilled my duty?” (meaning: Have I done all that I could?) After this slave – Sawab – was killed, the banner fell to the ground, and there was no one left to carry it. It remained fallen. Continuation of the Battle of Uhud The Martyrdom of Hamzah bin 'Abd Al-Muttalib, the Lion of Allah: Wahshi bin Harb, the killer of Hamzah, said: “I was a slave of Jubayr bin Mut'im, and his uncle, Tu'aymah bin 'Adiyy, had been killed on the Day of Badr. When Quraysh marched to Uhud, Jubayr said to me: ‘If you kill Hamzah, Muhammad's uncle, to avenge my uncle, you are free.’” He said: “I went out with the people – I was an Abyssinian who threw the spear as Abyssinians throw, seldom missing anything.” He said: “When the people met, I went out to watch Hamzah. I saw him in the midst of the people like a dark gray camel, cleaving through the people, with nothing standing up to him. By Allah, I was preparing for him, seeking him, concealing myself behind a tree or a rock so that he would come close to me, when Siba' bin 'Abd Al-'Uzza advanced towards him. When Hamzah saw him, he said to him: ‘Come to me, O son of the clitoris-cutter!’ (His mother was a circumciser). He said: “Hamzah struck him a blow that did not miss his head.” He said: “I shook my spear, and when I was satisfied with it, I thrust it at him. It struck his groin – his entrails – and came out between his legs. He tried to get up towards me but failed. I left him with it until he died. Then I came to him, took my spear, and returned to the camp. I sat there, having no need for anything else, for I had only killed him to be set free. When I reached Mecca, I was set free.” Maintaining Control of the Situation: Despite this heavy loss sustained by the Muslims with the martyrdom of Hamzah bin 'Abd Al-Muttalib, the Lion of Allah and the Lion of His Messenger, the Muslims maintained full control of the situation. Abu Bakr, 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, 'Ali bin Abi Talib, Az-Zubayr bin Al-'Awwam, Mus'ab bin 'Umayr, Talhah bin 'Ubaydullah, 'Abdullah bin Jahsh, Sa'd bin Mu'adh, Sa'd bin 'Ubadah, Sa'd bin Ar-Rabi', Anas bin An-Nadr, and their like, fought that day with a bravery that broke the resolve of the polytheists and weakened their limbs. From the Embrace of a Wife to the Clashing of Swords and Shields: Among the adventurous heroes that day was Hanzalah Al-Ghasil (The Washed by the Angels), who was Hanzalah bin Abi 'Amir. This Abu 'Amir is the monk who was nicknamed Al-Fasiq (the wicked one) and was mentioned recently. Hanzalah was newly married. When he heard the calls to war while he was with his wife, he broke free from her embrace and immediately went out for Jihad. When he met the polytheist army on the battlefield, he began to cleave through the ranks until he reached the commander of the polytheists, Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb. He almost killed him, had it not been that Allah granted him martyrdom. He charged Abu Sufyan. As he overpowered him and gained control, Shaddad bin Al-Aswad saw him and struck him until he killed him. The Role of the Archers' Detachment in the Battle: The detachment that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had appointed on the Mount of the Archers played a crucial role in directing the course of the battle in favor of the Islamic army. The Meccan cavalry, led by Khalid bin Al-Walid and assisted by Abu 'Amir Al-Fasiq, attacked three times to break the left flank of the Islamic army, so that they could infiltrate behind the Muslims, cause confusion and turmoil in their ranks, and inflict a crushing defeat upon them. However, these archers pelted them with arrows, causing all three of their attacks to fail. Defeat Befalls the Polytheists: Thus the grinding of the fierce war turned. The small Islamic army maintained complete control of the situation until the resolve of the polytheist champions weakened, and their ranks began to scatter right, left, front, and back, as if three thousand polytheists were facing thirty thousand Muslims, not a few hundred. The Muslims displayed the highest forms of bravery and certainty. After Quraysh exerted its utmost effort to repel the Muslim attack, it felt helplessness and weakness. Its resolve was broken – to the extent that no one dared to approach their banner, which had fallen after the killing of Sawab, to carry it and resume the fighting around it. They began to withdraw and resorted to flight, forgetting what they had been saying in their hearts about taking revenge, retaliation, and restoring their glory, majesty, and dignity. Ibn Ishaq said: “Then Allah sent down His victory upon the Muslims and fulfilled His promise to them. They were cutting them down with swords until they drove them away from the camp. There was no doubt about the defeat.” 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr narrated from his father that he said: “By Allah, I saw myself looking at the ankles – or calves – of Hind bint 'Utbah and her companions, fleeing, tucking up their garments, with their ankle bracelets visible.” etc. And in the hadith of Al-Bara' bin 'Azib in Al-Bukhari's Sahih: “When we met them, they fled until I saw the women running up the hill, lifting their legs so that their ankle bracelets became visible.” The Muslims pursued the polytheists, striking them with weapons and collecting the spoils. The Fatal Mistake of the Archers: While the small Islamic army was once again recording a crushing victory over Mecca, no less magnificent than the victory they had gained at Badr, the majority of the archers' detachment committed a fatal mistake that completely changed the situation, led to heavy losses for the Muslims, and nearly caused the killing of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It left the worst impact on their reputation and the prestige they had enjoyed after Badr. We have already mentioned the texts of the strict orders issued by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to these archers, commanding them to remain at their position on the hill in all circumstances, whether victory or defeat. However, despite these strict orders, when these archers saw the Muslims plundering the enemy's spoils, a trace of love for this world overcame them. Some of them said to others: “The spoils! The spoils! Your companions have prevailed, what are you waiting for?” As for their commander, 'Abdullah bin Jubayr, he reminded them of the Messenger of Allah's orders (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “Have you forgotten what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told you?” But the overwhelming majority paid no attention to this reminder and said: “By Allah, we will go to the people and take our share of the spoils!” Forty men from these archers then abandoned their positions on the hill and joined the main body of the army to participate in collecting the spoils. Thus, the backs of the Muslims were exposed, and only Ibn Jubayr and nine of his companions remained, resolutely holding their positions. Khalid ibn al-Walid seized this golden opportunity, making a lightning-fast maneuver until he reached the rear of the Muslim army. He soon annihilated 'Abdullah ibn Jubayr and his companions, then swooped down upon the Muslims from behind. His horsemen raised a shout by which the defeated polytheists realized the new development and turned back upon the Muslims. A woman among them – 'Amra bint 'Alqamah al-Harithiyyah – rushed forward and raised the polytheists' banner that lay on the ground. The polytheists rallied around it and gathered to it, calling one another until they united against the Muslims and stood firm for combat. The Muslims were surrounded from the front and the rear, caught between the two millstones.\\r \\r ## The Prophet's Valiant Stance Against the Encirclement:\\r \\r The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him - PBSD) was then in a small detachment – nine men of his Companions – at the rear of the Muslims. He was observing the Muslims' fierce fighting and pursuit of the polytheists when he was completely taken by surprise by Khalid's cavalry. He had two paths before him: either to save himself and his nine Companions quickly to a safe refuge, leaving his surrounded army to its predetermined fate, or to risk his life by calling his Companions to gather around him, establishing a strong front with them to break a path for his surrounded army toward the hills of Uhud.\\r \\r It was there that the genius and unparalleled bravery of the Messenger (PBSD) were manifested. He raised his voice, calling his Companions: “O Servants of Allah!” – knowing that the polytheists would hear his voice before the Muslims. Yet, he called and invited them, risking his life in that critical moment.\\r \\r Indeed, the polytheists became aware of him and rushed to him before the Muslims could reach him.\\r \\r ## The Dispersion of the Muslims in the Situation:\\r \\r As for the Muslims, when they were encircled, a faction of them lost their composure, caring only for themselves. They took the path of flight and abandoned the battlefield, not knowing what lay behind them. Some of this faction fled to Medina until they entered it, and some darted up the mountain. Another faction returned and became intermixed with the polytheists, and the two armies were confused and indistinguishable, resulting in the killing of Muslims by one another. Al-Bukhari reported from 'Aisha, who said: “When it was the Day of Uhud, the polytheists were clearly defeated, then Iblis (Satan) shouted: 'O Servants of Allah! Your rear!' – meaning: beware of those behind you – so their vanguard returned and fought their rearguard. Hudhayfah looked and saw his father, Al-Yaman, and cried out: 'O Servants of Allah, my father, my father!' She said: By Allah, they did not desist from him until they killed him. Then Hudhayfah said: 'May Allah forgive you.' 'Urwah said: By Allah, a remnant of good remained in Hudhayfah until he met Allah.”\\r \\r Severe disarray and chaos spread within the ranks of this faction. Many of them were lost, not knowing where to turn. While they were in this state, they heard a shouter proclaim: “Muhammad has been killed!” The last of their composure vanished, and the morale of many individuals collapsed or almost collapsed. Those who stopped fighting threw down their weapons in resignation, while others considered contacting 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy – the head of the hypocrites – to secure safe passage for them from Abu Sufyan.\\r \\r Anas ibn an-Nadr passed by these men who had resigned themselves and asked: “What are you waiting for?” They replied: “The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) has been killed.” He said: “What will you do with life after him? Stand up and die upon what the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) died upon!” Then he said: “O Allah, I apologize to You for what these (Muslims) have done, and I disavow myself before You from what those (polytheists) have done.” Then he advanced and met Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, and asked: “Where, O Abu 'Umar?” Anas replied: “Ah, the scent of Paradise, O Sa'd! I find it below Uhud!” Then he went on and fought the people until he was killed. He was not recognized until his sister recognized him by his fingers after the battle ended. He had between eighty and eighty-nine wounds from stabs by a spear, strikes by a sword, and shots from an arrow.\\r \\r Thabit ibn ad-Dahdah called out to his people: “O company of the Ansar! If Muhammad has been killed, Allah is Living and never dies! Fight for your religion, for Allah will grant you victory and aid you!” A number of Ansars rose to him, and he led them in a charge against Khalid's cavalry. He kept fighting them until Khalid killed him with a spear, and his companions were also killed.\\r \\r A man from the Muhajirun passed by a man from the Ansar who was wallowing in his blood and said: “O so-and-so, did you hear that Muhammad has been killed?” The Ansari replied: “If Muhammad has been killed, he has already conveyed [the message], so fight for your religion!”\\r \\r With such bravery and encouragement, the moral spirit returned to the Muslim soldiers, and their good sense and composure came back to them. They abandoned the idea of surrender or contacting Ibn Ubayy, took up their weapons, and began attacking the streams of polytheists, trying to force a path to the command center. News reached them that the report of the Prophet's (PBSD) death was a fabricated lie, which added strength to their strength. They succeeded in escaping the encirclement and gathering around a fortified center after engaging in fierce fighting and battling with extreme ferocity.\\r \\r There was a third faction whose only concern was the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). This faction rallied to the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) at the very beginning of the encirclement. At the forefront of these were Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, and others (may Allah be pleased with them). They were at the forefront of the combatants, but when they sensed the danger to his noble person – (peace and prayers be upon him) – they became the forefront of the defenders.\\r \\r ## The Intensification of the Fighting Around the Messenger of Allah (PBSD):\\r \\r While those factions were enduring the grips of the encirclement, being ground between the two millstones of the polytheists, the struggle was intensifying around the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). We mentioned that when the polytheists began the encirclement, there were only nine men with the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). When he called out to the Muslims, “Come to me! I am the Messenger of Allah!” the polytheists heard his voice and recognized him. They rushed toward him, attacking him and moving toward him with their full weight before any of the Muslim army could return to him. A fierce struggle ensued between the polytheists and these nine Companions, in which rare examples of love, self-sacrifice, valor, and heroism emerged.\\r \\r Muslim reported from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) was isolated on the Day of Uhud with seven men from the Ansar and two men from Quraysh. When they pressed hard upon him, he said: “Who will ward them off from us and be guaranteed Paradise? Or be my companion in Paradise?” A man from the Ansar advanced and fought until he was killed. Then they pressed hard upon him again, and it continued until all seven were killed. Then the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) said to his two companions – the two Qurayshites – “Our companions did not treat us justly.”\\r \\r The last of these seven was 'Umarah ibn Yazid ibn as-Sakan, who fought until he was rendered immobile by wounds and fell.\\r \\r ## The Most Critical Hour in the Prophet's Life (PBSD):\\r \\r After the fall of Ibn as-Sakan, the Messenger (PBSD) was left only with the two Qurayshites. It is reported in the two Sahih collections from Abu 'Uthman that he said: “There remained with the Prophet (PBSD) on some of those days when he was fighting only Talhah ibn 'Ubaydullah and Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas.” This was the most critical hour concerning the life of the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) and a golden opportunity for the polytheists. The polytheists did not hesitate to seize this opportunity. They focused their attack on the Prophet (PBSD) and hoped to eliminate him. 'Utbah ibn Abi Waqqas threw stones at him, causing him to fall on his side. His lower right incisor was broken, and his lower lip was wounded. 'Abdullah ibn Shihab az-Zuhri came forward and gashed his forehead. A stubborn horseman, 'Abdullah ibn Qami'ah, struck his shoulder with a fierce sword blow from which he complained for over a month, but he was unable to penetrate the two coats of mail. Then he struck his cheek (PBSD) with another fierce blow like the first, so that two links of the helmet's rings entered his cheek. He said: “Take that! I am Ibn Qami'ah!” The Messenger of Allah (PBSD), wiping the blood from his face, said: “May Allah abase you (O Ibn Qami'ah)!”\\r \\r It is reported in the Sahih that his incisor was broken and his head was gashed. He wiped the blood away and said: “How can a people prosper who gash the face of their Prophet and break his incisor while he calls them to Allah?” Then Allah, Exalted and Glorified be He, revealed: $$\\{لَيْسَ لَكَ مِنَ الأَمْرِ شَيْءٌ أَوْ يَتُوبَ عَلَيْهِمْ أَوْ يُعَذِّبَهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ ظَالِمُونَ\\}$$ (Al 'Imran: 128) - “Not for you is the decision (to condemn them or to forgive them), but (it is for Allah) to forgive them or to punish them; for indeed, they are wrongdoers.”\\r \\r In a narration by At-Tabarani, he said that day: “The wrath of Allah has intensified upon a people who bled the face of His Messenger.” Then he paused for a moment and said: “O Allah, forgive my people, for they do not know.” Likewise, in Sahih Muslim, he used to say: “My Lord, forgive my people, for they do not know.” And in *Ash-Shifa'* by Qadi 'Iyad, he said: “O Allah, guide my people, for they do not know.”\\r \\r There is no doubt that the polytheists aimed to put an end to the life of the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). However, the two Qurayshites, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas and Talhah ibn 'Ubaydullah, displayed rare heroism and fought with unparalleled valor, ensuring that – though they were only two – there was no way for the polytheists to succeed in their goal. They were among the most skilled archers of the Arabs, and they shot arrows tirelessly until they drove the polytheist detachment away from the Messenger of Allah (PBSD).\\r \\r As for Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) handed him his quiver and said: “Shoot, may my father and my mother be ransomed for you!” The fact that the Prophet (PBSD) never combined his parents for anyone other than Sa'd indicates the extent of his competence.\\r \\r As for Talhah ibn 'Ubaydullah, An-Nasa'i reported from Jabir the story of the polytheists gathering around the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) while he was with a few men from the Ansar. Jabir said: “The polytheists caught up with the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). He said: 'Who will deal with them?' Talhah said: 'Me.'” Jabir then mentioned the advancement of the Ansar and their being killed one after the other, similar to the narration of Muslim. When all the Ansar were killed, Talhah advanced. Jabir said: “Then Talhah fought the fight of eleven men until his hand was struck and his fingers were cut off. He said: 'Hass (ouch).' The Prophet (PBSD) said: 'Had you said Bismillah (In the Name of Allah), the angels would have raised you up while people watched.' ” Jabir said: “Then Allah repelled the polytheists.” It is reported in *Al-Iklil* by Al-Hakim that he was wounded on the Day of Uhud with thirty-nine or thirty-five wounds, and his finger became paralyzed (the index and the one next to it).\\r \\r Al-Bukhari reported from Qays ibn Abi Hazim: “I saw Talhah's hand paralyzed; he had protected the Prophet (PBSD) with it on the Day of Uhud.”\\r \\r At-Tirmidhi reported that the Prophet (PBSD) said about him that day: “Whoever wishes to look at a martyr walking upon the face of the earth, let him look at Talhah ibn 'Ubaydullah.”\\r \\r Abu Dawud at-Tayalisi reported from 'Aisha: “When Abu Bakr mentioned the Day of Uhud, he would say: 'That entire day belonged to Talhah.' ”\\r \\r Abu Bakr also said about him:\\r \\r *“O Talhah ibn 'Ubaydullah, the Gardens have become incumbent upon you,\\r And you have obtained the wide-eyed *Houris*.”*\\r \\r In that critical juncture and difficult hour, Allah sent down His unseen victory. In the two Sahih collections, Sa'd said: “I saw the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) on the Day of Uhud with two men fighting on his behalf, wearing white clothes, fighting with the fiercest intensity. I had never seen them before or after.” In one narration, they are identified as Jibril (Gabriel) and Mika'il (Michael).\\r \\r *\\r \\r ## The Battle of the Confederates (Al-Ahzab)\\r \\r Twenty men from the Jewish leaders and chiefs of Banu an-Nadir went out to Quraysh in Mecca, inciting them to invade the Messenger (PBSD) and promising them their support and victory. Quraysh responded favorably. Quraysh, having broken their promise to march out for Badr, saw this as an opportunity to save their reputation and fulfill their word.\\r \\r This delegation then went out to Ghatafan, inviting them to what they had invited Quraysh to, and they responded favorably. Then the delegation toured the Arab tribes, calling them to the same, and those who responded did so. Thus, the Jewish politicians and leaders succeeded in inciting the factions of disbelief (Al-Ahzab\/the Confederates) against the Prophet (PBSD), his call, and the Muslims.\\r \\r Indeed, Quraysh, Kinanah, and their allies from Tihamah came out from the south – led by Abu Sufyan – with four thousand men. Banu Sulaym met them at Marr az-Zahran. From the east came the tribes of Ghatafan: Banu Fazara, led by 'Uyaynah ibn Hisn; Banu Murrah, led by al-Harith ibn 'Awf; and Banu Ashja', led by Mis'ar ibn Rukhaylah, as well as Banu Asad and others.\\r \\r These factions advanced and moved toward Medina, according to a pre-arranged agreement.\\r \\r After some days, a massive army of ten thousand fighters gathered around Medina. An army whose number perhaps exceeded all the women, children, youth, and elderly in Medina.\\r \\r If these mobilized and confederated armies had reached the walls of Medina suddenly, it would have posed the greatest danger to the existence of the Muslims, possibly leading to total eradication. However, the command of Medina was vigilant, keeping its fingers on the pulse, scouting the circumstances, and assessing the developments. No sooner had these armies moved from their positions than Medina's intelligence conveyed the news of this dangerous advance to its command.\\r \\r The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) quickly convened a Supreme Consultative Council to address the plan for the defense of Medina. After discussions between the leaders and the council members, they agreed upon a decision put forward by the noble Companion Salman al-Farisi (may Allah be pleased with him). Salman said: “O Messenger of Allah, when we were in the land of Persia, if we were besieged, we would dig a trench around us.” This was a wise strategy previously unknown to the Arabs.\\r \\r The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) hastened to implement this plan. He assigned every ten men to dig forty cubits of the trench.\\r \\r The Muslims worked with diligence and energy digging the trench, and the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) encouraged them and participated in their work. In Al-Bukhari, Sahl ibn Sa'd reported: “We were with the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) at the Trench, and they were digging, and we were carrying the soil on our shoulders. Then the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) said:\\r \\r 'O Allah! There is no life but the life of the Hereafter, so forgive the Emigrants and the Helpers.' ”\\r \\r The Muslims were working with this energy while enduring extreme hunger that broke their hearts. Anas said: “The people of the Trench were brought a handful of barley, which was prepared for them with hot fat and placed before the people, who were hungry. It was bitter in the throat and foul-smelling.”\\r \\r Abu Talhah said: “We complained to the Prophet (PBSD) about hunger and lifted our garments to show him a single stone tied to our bellies. Then the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) lifted his garment to show two stones tied to his belly.”\\r \\r On this occasion, signs of prophethood occurred during the digging of the trench. Jabir ibn 'Abdullah saw the intense hunger of the Prophet (PBSD). He slaughtered a small animal, and his wife ground a *sa'* of barley. He secretly requested the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) to come with a few of his Companions. The Prophet (PBSD) then stood up with all the people of the Trench, who were a thousand. They ate from that food and were satiated, yet the meat pot continued to bubble as it was, and the dough continued to be baked as it was. The sister of Nu'man ibn Bashir brought a handful of dates to the Trench for her father and uncle to eat. She passed by the Messenger of Allah (PBSD), who asked her for the dates and spread them over a cloth. Then he called the people of the Trench, and they began to eat from it. The dates kept increasing until the people of the Trench finished, and there were still dates falling from the edges of the cloth.\\r \\r Greater than these two events is what Al-Bukhari reported from Jabir, who said: “While we were digging the Trench, a very hard rock appeared. They came to the Prophet (PBSD) and said: 'This is a rock that has appeared in the Trench.' He said: 'I am going down.' Then he stood up, his belly tied with a stone – and we had remained for three days without tasting any food. – The Prophet (PBSD) took the pickaxe, struck it, and it turned into a heap of loose sand.”\\r \\r Al-Bara' said: “On the Day of the Trench, a rock appeared to us in a part of the trench that the pickaxes would not affect. We complained about this to the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). He came, took the pickaxe, and said: 'Bismillah' (In the Name of Allah). Then he struck a blow and said: 'Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest)! I have been given the keys to Sham (Syria)! By Allah, I see its red palaces now!' Then he struck the second blow and cut off another part, and said: 'Allahu Akbar! I have been given Persia! By Allah, I see the white palace of Mada'in now!' Then he struck the third blow, cutting off the rest of the rock, and said: 'Allahu Akbar! I have been given the keys to Yemen! By Allah, I see the gates of San'a from my position!' ”\\r \\r Quraysh advanced with four thousand men until they camped at the confluence of the valleys of Rumah, between Al-Jurf and Za'abah. Ghatafan and their followers from Najd advanced with six thousand men until they camped at Dhanab Nuqmi, next to Uhud.\\r \\r $$\\{وَلَمَّا رَأَى الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الأَحْزَابَ قَالُوا هَذَا مَا وَعَدَنَا اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَصَدَقَ اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَمَا زَادَهُمْ إِلا إِيمَانًا وَتَسْلِيمًا\\}$$ (Al-Ahzab: 22)\\r \\r “And when the believers saw the Confederates, they said, 'This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us, and Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.' And it increased them only in faith and submission.”\\r \\r As for the hypocrites and the weak-hearted, their hearts were shaken by the sight of this army:\\r \\r $$\\{وَإِذْ يَقُولُ الْمُنَافِقُونَ وَالَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ مَا وَعَدَنَا اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ إِلا غُرُورًا\\}$$ (Al-Ahzab: 12)\\r \\r “And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease were saying, 'Allah and His Messenger did not promise us except delusion.'”\\r \\r The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) went out with three thousand Muslims, placing their backs toward Mount Sal', fortifying themselves there. The trench was between them and the disbelievers. Their battle cry was: “They shall not be victorious.” He appointed Ibn Umm Maktum as his deputy over Medina and commanded that the women and children be placed in the city's forts (*āṭām*).\\r \\r When the polytheists wanted to attack the Muslims and storm Medina, they found the wide trench separating them. They resorted to imposing a siege upon the Muslims, which they were unprepared for when they left their homes, as this plan – as they said – was a trick unknown to the Arabs. They had not considered it at all.\\r \\r The polytheists began circling the trench in anger, searching for a weak point to cross. The Muslims watched the movements of the polytheists, shooting arrows at them so that they would not dare to approach it, or be able to storm it, or pour earth into it to build a crossing.\\r \\r On some days, the polytheists made a considerable effort to storm the trench or build crossings in it, but the Muslims fought a glorious defense, shooting arrows at them and struggling fiercely until the polytheists failed in their attempts.\\r \\r Due to the engagement in this intense defense, some prayers were missed by the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) and the Muslims. In the two Sahih collections, Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab came on the Day of the Trench and started cursing the disbelievers of Quraysh. He said: “O Messenger of Allah, I almost didn't pray until the sun was about to set!” The Prophet (PBSD) said: “And I, by Allah, have not prayed it either.” Then we descended with the Prophet (PBSD) to Buṭḥān, and he performed ablution for the prayer, and we did so too. He prayed 'Asr after the sun had set, and then prayed Maghrib after it.\\r \\r The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) was so distressed by the missed prayer that he invoked against the polytheists. In Al-Bukhari, 'Ali reported that the Prophet (PBSD) said on the Day of the Trench: “May Allah fill their houses and graves with fire, just as they kept us preoccupied from the middle prayer until the sun set.”\\r \\r In Musnad Ahmad and Ash-Shafi'i, it is reported that they kept him from the prayers of Dhuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib, and 'Isha, and he prayed them all together. An-Nawawi said: “The way to reconcile these narrations is that the battle of the Trench lasted several days, so this happened on some days, and that on others.”\\r \\r From this, it is understood that the polytheists' attempts to cross and the Muslims' continuous resistance lasted for several days. However, since the trench was a barrier between the two armies, there was no direct combat or bloody war between them; they confined themselves to shooting arrows and dueling.\\r \\r During this exchange of arrows, men were killed from both armies, counted on the fingers: six Muslims and ten polytheists, with only one or two of them being killed by the sword.\\r \\r In this exchange of arrows, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh (may Allah be pleased with him) was struck by an arrow that severed his median arm vein (*al-kaḥl*). The man who shot him was a Qurayshite named Ḥibbān ibn al-'Ariqah. Sa'd prayed: “O Allah, You know that there is no one more beloved to me to strive against for Your sake than a people who denied Your Messenger and expelled him. O Allah, I think You have ended the war between us and them. If any fighting with Quraysh remains, keep me alive for them so that I may strive against them for Your sake. But if You have ended the war, then let it burst forth and make my death in it.” At the end of his supplication, he said: “And do not let me die until my eyes are delighted by Banu Qurayzah.”\\r \\r ## The Treachery of Banu Qurayzah\\r \\r While the Muslims were facing these hardships on the battlefront, the serpents of intrigue and conspiracy were writhing in their holes, seeking to inject poison into their bodies. The chief criminal of Banu an-Nadir, Huyayy ibn Akhṭab, went to the dwellings of Banu Qurayzah and approached Ka'b ibn Asad al-Quraẓi – the chief of Banu Qurayzah, the guarantor of their covenant and pact. Ka'b had contracted with the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) to support him if war befell him, as previously mentioned. Huyayy knocked on Ka'b's door, and Ka'b shut it before him. Huyayy kept speaking to him until he opened his door. Huyayy said: “O Ka'b, I have brought you the glory of eternity and a surging sea. I have brought you Quraysh with all its leaders and chiefs, and I have settled them at the confluence of the valleys of Rumah. And Ghatafan with all its leaders and chiefs, and I have settled them at Dhanab Nuqmi, next to Uhud. They have covenanted and contracted with me that they will not depart until we eradicate Muhammad and those with him.”\\r \\r Ka'b replied to him: “By Allah, you have brought me the humiliation of eternity and a rainless cloud that has shed its water; it thunders and lightens, but there is nothing in it. Woe to you, O Huyayy! Leave me with my current state, for I have seen nothing from Muhammad but truthfulness and fidelity.”\\r \\r Huyayy persisted in persuading Ka'b until he consented, on the condition that Huyayy gave him a covenant and oath by Allah that if Quraysh and Ghatafan returned without having harmed Muhammad, he would enter his fortress with Ka'b, and whatever befell Ka'b would befall him. Ka'b ibn Asad then broke his covenant and disavowed what was between him and the Muslims, joining the polytheists in the war against the Muslims.\\r \\r This noble action by the Prophet's (PBSD) aunt had a deep effect on preserving the women and children of the Muslims. It seems the Jews thought that those forts were protected by the Muslim army – even though they were completely empty of them – so they did not dare to attempt such an action a second time. However, they began supplying provisions to the pagan invaders as practical evidence of their joining them against the Muslims, so much so that the Muslims seized twenty camels of their provisions.\\r \\r The news reached the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) and the Muslims. He hastened to verify it, so as to ascertain Qurayzah's stance and deal with it appropriately from a military perspective. To verify the news, he sent the two Sa'ds: Sa'd ibn Mu'adh and Sa'd ibn 'Ubadah, as well as 'Abdullah ibn Rawahah and Khawwat ibn Jubayr. He said: “Go and see whether what has reached us about these people is true or not. If it is true, give me an allusion that I can understand, and do not discourage the people. If they are faithful to their pact, announce it openly to the people.” When they drew near, they found them in the vilest possible state. They openly insulted and showed enmity towards them, and reviled the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). They said: “Who is the Messenger of Allah? There is no covenant or agreement between us and Muhammad!” They returned from them, and when they approached the Messenger of Allah (PBSD), they alluded to him, saying: “'Aḍal and Al-Qārah,” meaning that they had committed treachery, like the treachery of 'Aḍal and Al-Qārah against the Companions of Ar-Raji'.\\r \\r ## Continuation of the Battle of the Confederates\\r \\r This was the most critical situation the Muslims had faced. Nothing stood between them and Qurayzah to prevent them from striking from the rear, while before them was a massive army they could not leave. Their children and women were close to these traitors, without protection or guard. They were as Allah (Exalted be He) says: $$\\{وَإِذْ زَاغَتْ الأَبْصَارُ وَبَلَغَتْ الْقُلُوبُ الْحَنَاجِرَ وَتَظُنُّونَ بِاللَّهِ الظُّنُونَ * هُنَالِكَ ابْتُلِيَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَزُلْزِلُوا زِلْزَالا شَدِيدًا\\}$$ (Al-Ahzab: 10-11) - “When eyes turned aside and hearts reached the throats, and you were thinking various thoughts about Allah. There the believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking.”\\r \\r Hypocrisy emerged from some hypocrites, one of whom said: “Muhammad used to promise us that we would eat the treasures of Khosrow and Caesar, but today one of us is not safe to go to the toilet.” And another said in an assembly of his people's men: “Our houses are exposed to the enemy, so allow us to go out and return to our homes, for they are outside Medina.” Banu Salimah even intended to fail. It was about them that Allah (Exalted be He) revealed: $$\\{وَإِذْ يَقُولُ الْمُنَافِقُونَ وَالَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ مَا وَعَدَنَا اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ إِلا غُرُورًا * وَإِذْ قَالَتْ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْهُمْ يَا أَهْلَ يَثْرِبَ لا مُقَامَ لَكُمْ فَارْجِعُوا وَيَسْتَأْذِنُ فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ النَّبِيَّ يَقُولُونَ إِنَّ بُيُوتَنَا عَوْرَةٌ وَمَا هِيَ بِعَوْرَةٍ إِنْ يُرِيدُونَ إِلا فِرَارًا\\}$$ (Al-Ahzab: 12-13) - “And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease were saying, 'Allah and His Messenger did not promise us except delusion.' And when a faction among them said, 'O people of Yathrib, there is no station for you, so return.' And a party of them asked the Prophet for permission, saying, 'Indeed, our houses are exposed,' while they were not exposed. They only intended to flee.”\\r \\r As for the Messenger of Allah (PBSD), he covered himself with his garment when the treachery of Qurayzah reached him. He lay down and remained for a long time until the distress intensified for the people. Then, the spirit of hope overcame him, and he stood up, saying: “Allahu Akbar! Rejoice, O company of Muslims, in the victory and aid of Allah!” He then began to plan how to confront the current situation. As part of this plan, he sent guards to Medina so that the children and women would not be taken by surprise. But a decisive step was necessary to lead to the breakdown of the Confederates. To achieve this, he wanted to make peace with 'Uyaynah ibn Ḥiṣn and al-Ḥārith ibn 'Awf, the two chiefs of Ghatafan, in exchange for one-third of Medina's dates, so that they would withdraw with their people, leaving the Muslims free to inflict a swift and overwhelming defeat upon Quraysh, whose strength and might they had tested repeatedly. Negotiations took place concerning this, and he consulted the two Sa'ds (ibn Mu'adh and ibn 'Ubadah). They said: “O Messenger of Allah, if Allah has commanded you this, then we hear and obey. But if it is something you are doing for our sake, we have no need of it. We and these people were in polytheism and idol worship, and they did not hope to eat any fruit from it except as guests or by purchase. Now that Allah has honored us with Islam, guided us to it, and empowered us through you, should we give them our wealth? By Allah, we will give them nothing but the sword!” He approved their view and said: “It is only something I am doing for you because I have seen the Arabs targeting you from a single bow.”\\r \\r Then Allah (Exalted and Glorified be He) – and to Him be all praise – brought about a matter from Himself by which He disgraced the enemy, routed their armies, and blunted their edge. Among what He prepared was a man from Ghatafan named Nu'aym ibn Mas'ud ibn 'Amir al-Ashja'i (may Allah be pleased with him) who came to the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, I have embraced Islam, but my people are unaware of my conversion. Command me as you wish.” The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) said: “You are but one man, so sow discord among them as much as you can, for war is deception.” He immediately went to Banu Qurayzah – with whom he had been a close friend in the *Jahiliyyah* (pre-Islamic era) – and entered upon them, saying: “You know my affection for you and the special bond between us.” They replied: “You speak the truth.” He said: “Quraysh is not like you. This is your country, where your wealth, children, and women are, and you cannot move from it to another place. As for Quraysh and Ghatafan, they have come to fight Muhammad and his Companions. Their country, wealth, and women are far away. If they find an opportunity, they will seize it; otherwise, they will return to their lands, leaving you alone with Muhammad, and he will take revenge on you.” They asked: “So what should we do, O Nu'aym?” He said: “Do not fight with them until they give you hostages.” They said: “You have given excellent advice.”\\r \\r Then Nu'aym continued on to Quraysh and said to them: “Do you know my affection and sincerity toward you?” They replied: “Yes.” He said: “The Jews have regretted what they did in breaking their pact with Muhammad and his Companions, and they have sent him a message that they will take hostages from you and hand them over to him, and then they will ally with him against you. If they ask you for hostages, do not give them any!” He then went to Ghatafan and told them the same thing.\\r \\r When it was the night of Saturday in Shawwal – year 5 AH – they sent to the Jews: “We are not in a land for prolonged stay, and the livestock are perishing. March out with us so that we may decisively engage Muhammad.” The Jews sent back: “Today is the Sabbath. You know what happened to those before us when they violated it. Furthermore, we will not fight with you until you send us hostages!” When their messengers returned with this, Quraysh and Ghatafan said: “By Allah, Nu'aym has spoken the truth to you!” They sent word to the Jews: “By Allah, we will not send anyone to you. Come out with us so that we may decisively engage Muhammad!” Qurayzah said: “By Allah, Nu'aym has spoken the truth to you!” The two parties lost trust in each other, division crept into their ranks, and their resolve weakened.\\r \\r The Muslims were praying to Allah (Exalted be He): “O Allah! Cover our defects and secure our fears!” The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) invoked against the Confederates, saying: “O Allah, Revealer of the Book, Swift in account! Defeat the Confederates! O Allah, defeat and shake them!”\\r \\r Allah heard the prayer of His Messenger and the Muslims. After division crept into the ranks of the polytheists and despair spread among them, Allah sent upon them an army of wind, which began to overturn their tents, did not leave a cooking pot but overturned it, and did not leave a tent-peg but uprooted it, giving them no rest. And He sent an army of angels to shake them and cast terror and fear into their hearts.\\r \\r On that cold, biting night, the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) sent Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman to bring him news of them. He found them in this state, preparing to depart. He returned to the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) and informed him of the people's departure. The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) awoke, and Allah had repelled His enemy in their rage, without them achieving any good. Allah spared him their fight. He fulfilled His promise, granted victory to His army, aided His servant, and defeated the Confederates alone. He returned to Medina.\\r \\r The Battle of the Trench took place in Shawwal of the fifth year of the Hijra, according to the soundest opinion. The polytheists besieged the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) and the Muslims for a month or so. It appears, by combining the sources, that the siege began in Shawwal and ended in Dhu al-Qa'dah. According to Ibn Sa'd, the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) departed from the Trench on Wednesday, with seven nights remaining of Dhu al-Qa'dah.\\r \\r The Battle of the Confederates was not a battle of casualties but a war of nerves. No fierce fighting took place in it, yet it was one of the most decisive battles in the history of Islam. It resulted in the breakup of the polytheists and proved that no force among the Arabs could eradicate the small, growing power in Medina, because the Arabs could not gather a stronger army than they had in the Confederates. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) said when Allah drove away the Confederates: “Now we will invade them, and they will not invade us; we will go to them.”\\r \\r *\\r \\r ## The Campaign against Banu Qurayzah:\\r \\r On the very day the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) returned to Medina, Jibril (Angel Gabriel) (peace be upon him) came to him at noon while he was bathing in the house of Umm Salamah. He said: “Have you already laid down your weapons? The angels have not laid down their weapons, and I have only just returned from pursuing the people. Stand up with those who are with you and go to Banu Qurayzah! I shall march ahead of you, shaking their fortresses and casting terror into their hearts.” Jibril marched forth in a procession of angels.\\r \\r The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) commanded a muezzin to announce among the people: “Let whoever is obedient and submissive not pray 'Asr (Afternoon Prayer) except at Banu Qurayzah!” He appointed Ibn Umm Maktum as his deputy over Medina and gave the banner to 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, sending him ahead to Banu Qurayzah. 'Ali marched until, drawing near their fortresses, he heard from them offensive speech towards the Messenger of Allah (PBSD).\\r \\r The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) went out in his procession of the Emigrants and the Helpers until he camped at a well of Qurayzah called the Well of Ana'. The Muslims hastened to obey his command, rising immediately and moving toward Qurayzah. The 'Asr prayer overtook them on the way. Some said: “We will not pray it except at Banu Qurayzah, as he commanded us,” so some men prayed 'Asr after 'Isha (Night Prayer). Others said: “He did not mean that, but he meant for us to leave quickly,” and they prayed it on the way. He did not censure either of the two groups.\\r \\r The Muslim army thus moved toward Banu Qurayzah in successive groups until they joined the Prophet (PBSD). They were three thousand men, with thirty horses. They besieged the fortresses of Banu Qurayzah and imposed a blockade upon them.\\r \\r When the siege intensified, their chief, Ka'b ibn Asad, offered them three options: 1) Embrace Islam and enter the religion of Muhammad (PBSD), thus securing their lives, property, children, and women. He told them: “By Allah, it has become clear to you that he is a sent Prophet, and he is the one you find in your Book.” 2) Kill their children and women with their own hands, and then go out to the Prophet (PBSD) with drawn swords, fighting him until they were victorious or all killed. 3) Attack the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) and his Companions on the Sabbath, as they were safe from fighting on that day. They refused to accept any of these three options. Thereupon, their chief, Ka'b ibn Asad, said in distress and anger: “Not a single man among you has spent one night of his life being resolute since his mother gave birth to him!”\\r \\r After rejecting these three options, nothing remained for Qurayzah but to submit to the judgment of the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). However, they wanted to contact some of their Muslim allies to find out what would happen to them if they submitted to his judgment. They sent a message to the Messenger of Allah (PBSD): “Send us Abu Lubabah so that we may consult him.” He was their ally, and his wealth and children were in their area. When they saw him, the men rose toward him, and the women and children wept in his face, which moved him. They asked: “O Abu Lubabah, do you think we should submit to Muhammad's judgment?” He replied: “Yes,” and pointed with his hand to his throat, indicating slaughter. He immediately realized that he had betrayed Allah and His Messenger. He went on his way and did not return to the Messenger of Allah (PBSD), but went to the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, tied himself to a pillar of the Mosque, and swore that no one would untie him but the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) with his own hand, and that he would never enter the land of Banu Qurayzah again. When the news reached the Messenger of Allah (PBSD), who had found his return slow, he said: “Had he come to me, I would have prayed for his forgiveness. But since he has done what he has done, I am not the one to release him from his place until Allah accepts his repentance.”\\r \\r Despite Abu Lubabah's gesture, Qurayzah decided to submit to the judgment of the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). The Jews could have endured a long siege due to the availability of food supplies, water, wells, and the strength of their fortresses, and because the Muslims were suffering from bitter cold and severe hunger in the open, coupled with the intense fatigue from continuous military operations since the start of the Battle of the Confederates. However, the war against Qurayzah was a war of nerves: Allah cast terror into their hearts, and their morale began to collapse. This collapse reached its peak when 'Ali ibn Abi Talib and Az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwam advanced, and 'Ali shouted: “O Battalion of Faith! By Allah, I will taste what Hamzah tasted, or I will open their fortress!”\\r \\r At that point, they hastened to submit to the judgment of the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) ordered the arrest of the men. They were put in fetters under the supervision of Muḥammad ibn Maslamah al-Anṣāri. The women and children were kept separate from the men in one area. The Aws rose and came to the Messenger of Allah (PBSD), saying: “O Messenger of Allah, you dealt with Banu Qaynuqa' as you know, and they were the allies of our brothers, the Khazraj. These are our allies, so be good to them.” He asked: “Would you not be pleased if a man from amongst you judged their fate?” They replied: “Yes.” He said: “Then it is for Sa'd ibn Mu'adh.” They replied: “We are pleased.”\\r \\r They sent for Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, who was in Medina, having been unable to join them because of the wound that had severed his median arm vein during the Battle of the Confederates. He was mounted on a donkey and brought to the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). His relatives surrounding him began to say: “O Sa'd, be gentle with your allies, be good to them, for the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) has appointed you to judge them so that you may be good to them.” He remained silent, not replying to them. When they pressed him further, he said: “The time has come for Sa'd not to fear the blame of any blamer for the sake of Allah.” When they heard that from him, some of them returned to Medina to mourn the people to their kin.\\r \\r When Sa'd reached the Prophet (PBSD), he said to the Companions: “Stand up for your chief.” When they helped him dismount, they said: “O Sa'd, these people have agreed to abide by your judgment.” He asked: “Is my judgment binding on them?” They replied: “Yes.” He asked: “And on the Muslims?” They replied: “Yes.” He asked: “And on those here?” He turned his face and gestured toward the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) out of respect and reverence. They said: “Yes, and on you.” Sa'd then judged: “I rule that the men should be killed, the offspring be taken captive, and the wealth be divided.” The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) said: “You have judged concerning them with the judgment of Allah from above seven heavens.”\\r \\r Sa'd's judgment was utterly just and fair. For, in addition to the heinous treachery they had committed, Banu Qurayzah had gathered for the eradication of the Muslims: one thousand five hundred swords, two thousand spears, three hundred coats of mail, and five hundred shields and targets, which the Muslims obtained after the conquest of their homes.\\r \\r The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) ordered that Banu Qurayzah be confined in the house of Bint al-Harith, a woman from Banu an-Najjar, and trenches were dug for them in the market of Medina. Then he commanded that they be taken to the trenches in groups, where their necks were struck. Ka'b ibn Asad, their chief, asked those remaining in confinement: “What do you think he is doing with us?” He said: “Do you never reason? Don't you see that the caller does not stop, and those who depart from you do not return? By Allah, it is the slaughter!” They were between six hundred and seven hundred men, and their necks were struck.\\r \\r Thus, the serpents of treachery and perfidy were eradicated, those who had broken the firm covenant and aided the Confederates in the eradication of the Muslims at the most critical hour of their lives. By their action, they had become major war criminals deserving of trial and execution. The devil of Banu an-Nadir, and one of the great criminals of the Battle of the Confederates, Ḥuyayy ibn Akhṭab – the father of Safiyyah, the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her) – was killed with them. He had entered Banu Qurayzah's fortress when Quraysh and Ghatafan withdrew, in fulfillment of the promise he had given to Ka'b ibn Asad when he came to incite him to treachery during the Campaign of the Confederates. When he was brought, he was wearing a robe that he had torn on all sides by the length of a fingertip so that it would not be taken from him, his hands tied to his neck with a rope. He said to the Messenger of Allah (PBSD): “By Allah, I have never blamed myself for being hostile to you, but whoever struggles against Allah is defeated.” Then he said: “O people, there is no harm in Allah's decree. It is a written decree, a destiny, and a slaughter that Allah has decreed for the Children of Israel.” Then he sat down, and his neck was struck.\\r \\r Only one woman was killed among their women, the one who had thrown the millstone upon Khallad ibn Suwayd and killed him. She was killed for that reason.\\r \\r The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) had ordered the killing of those who had reached puberty (those who had grown pubic hair) and the sparing of those who had not. Among those who had not reached puberty was 'Aṭiyyah al-Quraẓi, who was spared. He embraced Islam and became a Companion.\\r \\r Thābit ibn Qays requested the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) to grant him Az-Zubayr ibn Bāṭā, his family, and his wealth. Az-Zubayr had a favor with Thābit, so he granted them to him. Thābit ibn Qays said to Az-Zubayr: “The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) has granted you to me, and he has granted me your wealth and family, so they are yours.” Az-Zubayr, having learned of the killing of his people, said: “I ask you, by the favor I have with you, O Thābit, that you do not join me with my loved ones!” Thābit struck his neck, joining him with his loved ones among the Jews. Thābit spared Az-Zubayr ibn Bāṭā's son, 'Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn az-Zubayr, who embraced Islam and became a Companion. Umm al-Mundhir Salma bint Qays an-Najjāriyyah requested Rifā'ah ibn Samu'al al-Quraẓi, and he was granted to her. She spared him, he embraced Islam, and became a Companion.\\r \\r A few men among them embraced Islam that night before the surrender, and their lives, property, and children were secured. A man named 'Amr fled that night; he had not participated in Banu Qurayzah's treachery against the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). Muḥammad ibn Maslamah, the leader of the Prophetic Guard, saw him and let him go when he recognized him. It is unknown where he went.\\r \\r The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) divided the wealth of Banu Qurayzah after taking out the fifth (Khums). He allocated three shares to the cavalryman (two for the horse and one for the rider), and one share to the foot soldier. He sent a group of the captives to Najd under the supervision of Sa'd ibn Zayd al-Ansari, who exchanged them for horses and weapons.\\r \\r The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) chose for himself from the women Rayḥānah bint 'Amr ibn Khanāqah. She remained with him until his death while she was his property. This is what Ibn Ishaq said. Al-Kalbi said that he (PBSD) freed her and married her in 6 AH, and she died upon his return from the Farewell Pilgrimage and was buried in Al-Baqi'.\\r \\r When the matter of Qurayzah was concluded, the supplication of the righteous servant Sa'd ibn Mu'adh (may Allah be pleased with him), mentioned during the Battle of the Confederates, was answered. The Prophet (PBSD) had pitched a tent for him in the Mosque to visit him nearby. When the matter of Qurayzah was concluded, his wound burst open again. 'Aisha said: “It burst from his chest. While a tent of Banu Ghifār was in the Mosque, they were not startled until the blood flowed toward them. They asked: 'O people of the tent, what is this coming to us from your side?' ” It was Sa'd whose wound was profusely bleeding. He died from it.\\r \\r It is reported in the two Sahih collections from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) said: “The Throne of the Most Merciful shook at the death of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh.” At-Tirmidhi authenticated a Hadith from Anas who said: “When the funeral of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh was carried, the hypocrites said: 'How light his bier is!' The Messenger of Allah (PBSD) said: 'The angels were carrying it.' ”\\r \\r One man from the Muslims was killed during the siege of Banu Qurayzah, Khallād ibn Suwayd, upon whom the woman from Qurayzah threw the millstone. Abu Sinān ibn Miḥṣan, 'Ukāsha's brother, also died during the siege.\\r \\r As for Abu Lubabah, he remained tied to the pillar for six nights. His wife would come at the time of every prayer, untie him for the prayer, and then he would return and tie himself to the pillar. His repentance was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (PBSD) at dawn, while he was in the house of Umm Salamah. She stood at the door of her chamber and said to Abu Lubabah: “Rejoice! Allah has accepted your repentance!” The people rushed to release him, but he refused to be untied by anyone except the Messenger of Allah (PBSD). When the Prophet (PBSD) passed by on his way out for the Fajr (Dawn) prayer, he released him.\\r \\r This campaign took place in Dhu al-Qa'dah of the fifth year of the Hijra. The siege lasted twenty-five nights.\\r \\r Allah (Exalted be He) revealed verses from Surah Al-Ahzab concerning the Battle of the Confederates and Banu Qurayzah, commenting on the most important parts of the event, including the state of the believers and the hypocrites, the defeat of the Confederates, and the results of the treachery of the People of the Book.\\r \\r ## The Conquest of Mecca (Ghazuat Fatḥ Makkah) Ibn al-Qayyim said: \"It is the Greatest Conquest (al-Fath al-A’dham), with which Allah honored His religion, His Messenger, His army, and His faithful party. Through it, He rescued His town and His House, which He made a guidance for all peoples, from the hands of the disbelievers and polytheists. It is the Conquest for which the inhabitants of the heavens rejoiced, whose tents of glory were pitched on the shoulders of the Gemini, by which people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and by which the face of the earth shone with light and joy. \" Cause of the Expedition We mentioned regarding the incident of Al-Hudaybiyyah that a clause of that treaty stipulated that whoever wished to enter into the covenant of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) could do so, and whoever wished to enter into the covenant of Quraysh could do so. The tribe that joined either party was considered part of that faction, so any aggression against any of those tribes would be considered aggression against that faction. According to this clause, the tribe of Khuzā'ah entered into the covenant of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and Banū Bakr entered into the covenant of Quraysh. Both tribes were now safe from the other. Old enmity and tensions had existed between the two tribes in the Jāhiliyyah (pre-Islamic era). When Islam came, and this truce was concluded, and each party was safe from the other, Banū Bakr took advantage and wished to exact old revenge on Khuzā'ah. Nawfal ibn Mu'awiyah ad-Dīlī went out with a group of Banū Bakr in the month of Sha'bān in 8 AH, and they attacked Khuzā'ah at night while they were at a watering hole called al-Watīr. They killed some of their men, skirmished, and fought. Quraysh assisted Banū Bakr with weapons, and men from Quraysh fought alongside them, exploiting the darkness of the night, until they drove Khuzā'ah into the sacred precinct (al-Haram). When they reached it, Banū Bakr said: \"O Nawfal, we have entered the Haram, fear your God! Fear your God! \" He spoke a terrible word: \"There is no God today, O Banū Bakr! Take your revenge! By my life, you steal in the Haram, so why not take your revenge in it? \" When Khuzā'ah entered Makkah, they sought refuge in the house of Budayl ibn Warqā' al-Khuzā'ī and the house of one of their freedmen named Rāfi'. 'Amr ibn Sālim al-Khuzā'ī hastened to leave until he came to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) in Al-Madīnah, and stood before him while he was sitting in the Mosque among the people, and recited [verses of poetry asking for help]. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) then said: \"You have been helped, O 'Amr ibn Sālim! \" Then a cloud appeared in the sky, and he said: \"This cloud is pouring forth rain in support of Banū Ka'b. \" Then Budayl ibn Warqā' al-Khuzā'ī went out with a group of Khuzā'ah until they came to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) in Al-Madīnah. They informed him of those who had been killed among them and of the support Quraysh had given to Banū Bakr against them. Then they returned to Makkah. Abū Sufyān leaves for Al-Madīnah to renew the treaty There is no doubt that what Quraysh and its allies did was pure treachery and an explicit breach of the covenant, for which there was no justification. Therefore, Quraysh quickly realized their treachery, feared and sensed its dire consequences. They held a consultative council and decided to send their leader, Abū Sufyān, as their representative to renew the truce. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) had informed his Companions of what Quraysh would do following their treachery. He said: \"It is as if you see Abū Sufyān coming to you to strengthen the treaty and extend the term. \" Abū Sufyān left – as Quraysh had decided – and met Budayl ibn Warqā' at 'Usfān – who was returning from Al-Madīnah to Makkah. He asked: \"Where have you come from, O Budayl? \" – thinking he had gone to the Prophet (PBUH). Budayl replied: \"I traveled with Khuzā'ah along this coast and in the bottom of this valley. \" Abū Sufyān asked: \"Did you not go to Muhammad? \" He replied: \"No. \" When Budayl left for Makkah, Abū Sufyān said: \"If he went to Al-Madīnah, he must have been fed dates there. \" He went to his she-camel's resting place, took some of its droppings, crushed them, and saw date stones in them. He said: \"I swear by Allah, Budayl has indeed been to see Muhammad. \" Abū Sufyān arrived in Al-Madīnah and went to his daughter, Umm Habībah. When he went to sit on the bed of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), she folded it away from him. He said: \"O my daughter, have you kept this bed away from me, or have you kept me away from it? \" She said: \"Rather, it is the bed of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and you are a polytheist and impure man. \" He said: \"By Allah, something evil has afflicted you since I left. \" He then went out until he came to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and spoke to him, but he did not respond to anything. He then went to Abū Bakr and asked him to speak to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), but Abū Bakr said: \"I will not do it. \" He then went to 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb and spoke to him, but 'Umar said: \"Should I intercede for you with the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)? By Allah, if I had nothing but ants to fight you with, I would fight you with them! \" Then he came and went in to 'Alī ibn Abī Tālib, and with him were Fātimah, and Hasan, a young boy crawling between them. He said: \"O 'Alī, you are the closest person to me in kinship, and I have come for a need, so do not let me return disappointed as I came. Intercede for me with Muhammad. \" 'Alī said: \"Woe to you, O Abū Sufyān, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) has decided on a matter about which we cannot speak to him. \" He turned to Fātimah and said: \"Would you command this son of yours to grant protection among the people, so that he may be the master of the Arabs until the end of time? \" She said: \"By Allah, my son has not reached the age to grant protection among the people, and no one grants protection against the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). \" At this, the world darkened before Abū Sufyān's eyes. He said to 'Alī ibn Abī Tālib in distress, agitation, despair, and disappointment: \"O Abū al-Hasan, I see that matters have become difficult for me, so advise me. \" 'Alī said: \"By Allah, I know nothing that will benefit you. However, you are the master of Banū Kinānah, so stand up and grant protection among the people, then return to your land. \" Abū Sufyān asked: \"Do you think that will benefit me at all? \" 'Alī replied: \"No, by Allah, I do not think so, but I have found nothing else for you. \" Abū Sufyān then stood up in the Mosque and said: \"O people, I have granted protection among the people! \" Then he mounted his camel and departed. When he arrived back with Quraysh, they asked: \"What is behind you? \" He replied: \"I went to Muhammad and spoke to him, but by Allah, he did not respond to anything. Then I went to the son of Abū Quhāfah (Abū Bakr) and found no good in him. Then I went to 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb, and I found him to be the nearest enemy. Then I went to 'Alī, and I found him to be the softest of the people. He advised me to do something, and by Allah, I do not know if it will benefit me or not. \" They asked: \"What did he command you to do? \" He said: \"He commanded me to grant protection among the people, and I did so. \" They asked: \"Did Muhammad approve of that? \" He said: \"No. \" They said: \"Woe to you, that man only played a trick on you. \" He replied: \"No, by Allah, I found nothing else. \" Preparation for the Expedition and the attempt to conceal it The narration of At-Tabarānī reports that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) ordered 'Ā'ishah – three days before the news of the covenant breach reached him – to prepare him, without anyone knowing. Abū Bakr entered upon her and asked: \"O my daughter, what is this preparation? \" She said: \"By Allah, I don't know. \" He said: \"By Allah, this is not the time for the expedition against Banū al-Asfar [the Byzantines]. Where does the Messenger of Allah intend to go? \" She said: \"By Allah, I have no knowledge. \" On the morning of the third day, 'Amr ibn Sālim al-Khuzā'ī arrived with forty riders, and recited [verses of poetry]: \"O Lord, I appeal to Muhammad... \" [the verses]. Then the people learned about the breach of the covenant. After 'Amr came Budayl, then Abū Sufyān, and the news was confirmed to the people. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) then ordered them to prepare and informed them that he was heading to Makkah. He said: \"O Allah, keep the eyes and news from Quraysh until we surprise them in their land. \" To further concealment and deception, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sent a small detachment of eight men, led by Abū Qatādah ibn Rib'ī, to Bātn Idham, between Dhū Khashab and Dhū al-Marwah, three *burd* (about 36 miles) from Al-Madīnah, at the beginning of the month of Ramadān in 8 AH; so that people might think he was heading in that direction and for the news to spread accordingly. This detachment continued its march until, upon reaching their destination, they were informed that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) had set out for Makkah, and they marched toward him until they caught up. Hātib ibn Abī Balta'ah wrote a letter to Quraysh informing them of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)'s march toward them. He gave it to a woman and promised her a reward to deliver it to Quraysh. She placed it in the braids of her hair and left with it. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) received news from the heavens about what Hātib had done. He sent 'Alī, al-Miqdād, az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwām, and Abū Marthad al-Ghanawī, saying: \"Go until you reach Rawdat Khākh, for there is a traveling woman there with a letter for Quraysh. \" They set out, their horses racing, until they found the woman at that place. They made her dismount and said: \"Do you have a letter? \" She replied: \"I have no letter. \" They searched her baggage but found nothing. 'Alī said to her: \"I swear by Allah, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) has not lied, nor have we. By Allah, you will bring out the letter, or we will strip you! \" When she saw his seriousness, she said: \"Turn away. \" He turned away, and she untied the braids of her hair and took out the letter. She handed it to them, and they brought it to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). It read: \"From Hātib ibn Abī Balta'ah to Quraysh, \" informing them of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)'s march. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) called Hātib and asked: \"What is this, O Hātib? \" He replied: \"Do not be hasty with me, O Messenger of Allah. By Allah, I believe in Allah and His Messenger. I have neither apostatized nor changed, but I was a man attached to Quraysh; I am not one of their own people, and I have family, a clan, and a child among them, and no relatives to protect them. Whereas those with you have relatives who protect them. I loved, since I lacked that, to establish a favor with them by which they would protect my relatives. \" 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb said: \"Leave me, O Messenger of Allah, to strike his neck, for he has betrayed Allah and His Messenger, and he has been a hypocrite. \" The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: \"He has witnessed Badr. And what makes you know, O 'Umar, that perhaps Allah looked at the people of Badr and said: 'Do what you wish, for I have forgiven you.' \" 'Umar's eyes shed tears, and he said: \"Allah and His Messenger know best. \" Thus, Allah kept the eyes away, and no news of the Muslims' preparation and readiness for the march and battle reached Quraysh. The Muslim Army moves toward Makkah Ten days into the blessed month of Ramadān in 8 AH, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) departed from Al-Madīnah, heading towards Makkah, with ten thousand Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). He left Abū Ruhm al-Ghifārī as his deputy in Al-Madīnah. When he was at Al-Juhfah – or just beyond – his uncle, Al-'Abbās ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, met him. He had left with his family, immigrating as a Muslim. Then, when the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was at Al-Abwā', his cousin, Abū Sufyān ibn al-Hārith, and his maternal cousin, 'Abdullāh ibn Abī Umayyah, met him. He turned away from them because of the intense harm and satire he had received from them. Umm Salamah said to him: \"Do not let your cousin and the son of your aunt be the most wretched of people because of you. \" 'Alī said to Abū Sufyān ibn al-Hārith: \"Go to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) from the front and say to him what Joseph's brothers said to Joseph: {They said: 'By Allah! Allah has indeed preferred you over us, and we were certainly sinners.'} [Yūsuf: 91], for he will not be pleased that anyone has better words than him. \" Abū Sufyān did this, and the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said to him: {He said: 'No reproach upon you this day. May Allah forgive you; He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.'} [Yūsuf: 92]. Abū Sufyān then recited some verses, [after which] the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) struck his chest and said: \"Was it you who drove me out wherever I went? \" The Muslim Army encamps at Marr adh-Dhahran The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) continued his journey while fasting, and the people were fasting, until he reached Al-Kudayd – a watering hole between 'Usfān and Qudayd – where he broke his fast, and the people broke theirs with him. He then continued his journey until he encamped at Marr adh-Dhahran (Wādī Fātimah), arriving in the evening. He ordered the army, and they lit fires. Ten thousand fires were lit. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) appointed 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb (may Allah be pleased with him) over the guard. Abū Sufyān before the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) Al-'Abbās – after the Muslims encamped at Marr adh-Dhahran – rode the white mule of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and went out, searching, hoping to find some woodcutters or someone to inform Quraysh so that they would come out to ask the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) for amnesty before he entered [Makkah]. Allah had kept the news hidden from Quraysh, and they were in anxiety and anticipation. Abū Sufyān had gone out to spy for news; he had gone out with Hakīm ibn Hizām and Budayl ibn Warqā' to seek intelligence. Al-'Abbās said: \"By Allah, I was riding it – meaning the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)'s mule – when I heard the speech of Abū Sufyān and Budayl ibn Warqā' as they were talking to each other. Abū Sufyān was saying: 'I have never seen fires or an army like tonight.' Budayl said: 'By Allah, this is Khuzā'ah, provoked by the war.' Abū Sufyān replied: 'Khuzā'ah is too few and too humble for these to be their fires and their army.' \" Al-'Abbās said: \"I recognized his voice and said: 'Abū Hanzalah?' He recognized my voice and said: 'Abū al-Fadl?' I said: 'Yes.' He asked: 'What is wrong with you? May my father and mother be your ransom!' I said: 'This is the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) with the people. By Allah, what a morning for Quraysh!' \" Abū Sufyān asked: \"What is the plan? May my father and mother be your ransom! \" I replied: \"By Allah, if he finds you, he will strike your neck. Ride behind me on this mule until I bring you to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and ask him for amnesty for you. \" He rode behind me, and his two companions returned. Al-'Abbās said: \"I brought him, and whenever we passed by a fire of the Muslims, they would ask: 'Who is this?' When they saw the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)'s mule and me upon it, they would say: 'The Messenger of Allah (PBUH)'s uncle on his mule.' Until I passed by the fire of 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb. He asked: 'Who is this?' He stood up towards me, and when he saw Abū Sufyān on the back of the animal, he said: 'Abū Sufyān, the enemy of Allah? Praise be to Allah who has given us power over you without any treaty or covenant!' Then he rushed towards the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). I spurred the mule and rushed ahead. I jumped off the mule and entered upon the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). 'Umar entered upon him and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, this is Abū Sufyān! Let me strike his neck.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I have granted him protection.' Then I sat next to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and took hold of his head, saying: 'By Allah, no one will have a private conversation with him tonight besides me.' When 'Umar spoke much about him, I said: 'Be gentle, O 'Umar, by Allah, if he were from the men of Banū 'Adī ibn Ka'b, you would not say such a thing!' 'Umar replied: 'Be gentle, O 'Abbās, by Allah, your conversion to Islam was dearer to me than the conversion of Al-Khattāb (my father), if he had converted. And that is only because I know that your conversion was dearer to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) than the conversion of Al-Khattāb.' \" The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: \"Take him, O 'Abbās, to your tent, and when you wake up, bring him to me. \" I went, and when I woke up, I brought him to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). When he saw him, he said: \"Woe to you, O Abū Sufyān, hasn't the time come for you to know that there is no god but Allah? \" He replied: \"May my father and mother be your ransom! How forbearing, generous, and kind you are! I thought that if there were a god other than Allah, he would certainly have helped me by now. \" The Prophet said: \"Woe to you, O Abū Sufyān, hasn't the time come for you to know that I am the Messenger of Allah? \" He replied: \"May my father and mother be your ransom! How forbearing, generous, and kind you are! As for this, there is still something in my soul until now. \" Al-'Abbās said to him: \"Woe to you! Accept Islam and testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, before your neck is struck! \" So, he accepted Islam and bore the testimony of truth. Al-'Abbās said: \"O Messenger of Allah, Abū Sufyān is a man who loves pride, so grant him something. \" The Prophet said: \"Yes, whoever enters the house of Abū Sufyān is safe, whoever locks his door upon himself is safe, and whoever enters the Sacred Mosque is safe. \" The Muslim Army departs Marr adh-Dhahran for Makkah On that morning – the morning of Tuesday, the seventeenth of Ramadān, 8 AH – the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) departed from Marr adh-Dhahran for Makkah. He ordered Al-'Abbās to detain Abū Sufyān in the narrow pass of the valley near the mountain's nose, so that Allah's armies would pass by him, and he would see them. Al-'Abbās did so. The tribes passed by with their banners. Whenever a tribe passed by, Abū Sufyān would ask: \"O 'Abbās, who are these? \" He would say – for example –: \"Sulaym. \" Abū Sufyān would say: \"What do I have to do with Sulaym? \" Then another tribe would pass by, and he would say: \"O 'Abbās, who are these? \" He would say: \"Muzaynah. \" He would say: \"What do I have to do with Muzaynah? \" Thus, all the tribes passed. No tribe passed by but he asked Al-'Abbās about it, and when he informed him, he said: \"What do I have to do with Banū so-and-so? \" Until the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) passed by with his green phalanx, including the Emigrants and the Helpers, from whom nothing was visible but their eyes due to the iron [armor]. Abū Sufyān exclaimed: \"Subhān Allāh! O 'Abbās, who are these? \" Al-'Abbās replied: \"This is the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) with the Emigrants and the Helpers. \" Abū Sufyān said: \"No one has the power or ability to stand against these. \" Then he said: \"By Allah, O Abū al-Fadl, your nephew's dominion has become immense today! \" Al-'Abbās replied: \"O Abū Sufyān, it is Prophethood! \" Abū Sufyān said: \"Yes, then it is. \" The banner of the Helpers was with Sa'd ibn 'Ubādah. When he passed Abū Sufyān, he said to him: \"Today is the day of massacre! Today, the sanctity [of the place] will be violated! Today, Allah has humbled Quraysh! \" When Sa'd came near the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), Abū Sufyān said: \"O Messenger of Allah, did you not hear what Sa'd said? \" The Prophet asked: \"And what did he say? \" Abū Sufyān repeated his words. 'Uthmān and 'Abd ar-Rahmān ibn 'Awf said: \"O Messenger of Allah, we do not feel safe that he may attack Quraysh. \" The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: \"Rather, today is the day the Ka'bah will be glorified! Today is the day Allah has honored Quraysh! \" Then he sent for Sa'd, removed the standard from him, and gave it to his son, Qays, considering that the standard had not been taken from Sa'd. It is also said that he gave it to Az-Zubayr. Quraysh is surprised by the advance of the Muslim Army When the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) passed Abū Sufyān and proceeded, Al-'Abbās said to him: \"Hurry to your people! \" Abū Sufyān rushed until he entered Makkah and shouted at the top of his voice: \"O people of Quraysh, this is Muhammad! He has come to you with what you cannot withstand! Whoever enters the house of Abū Sufyān is safe! \" His wife, Hind bint 'Utbah, stood up, grabbed his mustache, and said: \"Kill this inflated, obese man with thin shanks! What a wretched scout for a people! \" Abū Sufyān said: \"Woe to you, do not let this woman deceive you! He has come to you with what you cannot withstand. Whoever enters the house of Abū Sufyān is safe! \" They said: \"May Allah curse you! What good is your house to us? \" He said: \"Whoever locks his door upon himself is safe, and whoever enters the Mosque is safe. \" The people dispersed to their homes and to the Mosque. Some lowlifes gathered and said: \"Let us put these [the leaders] forward. If Quraysh succeeds, we will be with them. If they are defeated, we will give what is asked of us. \" The fools and reckless ones of Quraysh gathered with 'Ikrimah ibn Abī Jahl, Safwān ibn Umayyah, and Suhayl ibn 'Amr at Al-Khandamah to fight the Muslims. Among them was a man from Banū Bakr – Himās ibn Qays – who had previously been preparing his weapons. His wife asked him: \"Why are you preparing what I see? \" He replied: \"For Muhammad and his companions. \" She said: \"By Allah, nothing can stand against Muhammad and his companions. \" He said: \"By Allah, I hope to make some of them your servants. \" Then he said [a poem]: *If they advance today, I have no excuse,* *This is a complete weapon and instrument,* *And a swift-sheathed, double-edged [sword].* This man was among those who gathered at Al-Khandamah. The Muslim Army at Dhū Tuwā As for the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), he proceeded until he reached Dhū Tuwā – and he was bowing his head in humility to Allah when he saw the honor of the Conquest Allah had granted him, to the extent that the hair of his beard almost touched the middle of his saddle. There, he divided his army. Khālid ibn al-Walīd was in charge of the right wing – which included Aslam, Sulaym, Ghifār, Muzaynah, Juhaynah, and tribes from the Arab tribes. He commanded him to enter Makkah from below, saying: \"If anyone from Quraysh confronts you, reap them down unsparingly, until you meet me at As-Safā. \" Az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwām was in charge of the left wing, and he carried the banner of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). He commanded him to enter Makkah from above – from Kadā' – and to plant his banner at Al-Hajūn, and not to leave until he came to him. Abū 'Ubaydah was in charge of the foot soldiers and the unarmed men. He commanded him to take the bottom of the valley until he settled facing Makkah before the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). The Muslim Army enters Makkah Each battalion of the Muslim army moved along the route assigned for its entry. As for Khālid and his companions, they did not meet anyone from the polytheists except that they overcame them. Two Muslims were killed among his companions: Kurz ibn Jābir al-Fihrī and Khunays ibn Khālid ibn Rabī'ah. They had strayed from the army and taken a different path, and were both killed. As for the fools of Quraysh, Khālid and his companions met them at Al-Khandamah and they engaged in some fighting. They killed twelve men from the polytheists. The polytheists fled, and Himās ibn Qays – who was preparing weapons to fight the Muslims – fled until he entered his house and said to his wife: \"Lock the door behind me! \" She said: \"And what about what you were saying? \" He replied [referencing his poem] : *And a swift-sheathed, double-edged [sword].* Khālid proceeded through Makkah until he met the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) at As-Safā. As for Az-Zubayr, he advanced until he planted the banner of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) at Al-Hajūn, near the Mosque of Al-Fath, and pitched a tent for him there. He did not move until the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) came to him. The Messenger (PBUH) enters the Sacred Mosque and purifies it of idols Then the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) arose, with the Emigrants and the Helpers before him, behind him, and around him, until he entered the Mosque. He went to the Black Stone (al-Hajar al-Aswad) and kissed it. Then he performed the circuit (Tawāf) around the House, holding a bow in his hand. There were three hundred and sixty idols around the House. He began to strike them with the bow and say: {The truth has come, and falsehood has vanished. Indeed, falsehood is ever bound to vanish.} [Al-Isrā’: 81], {Say: 'The truth has come, and falsehood can neither originate [anything] nor restore [what it has destroyed].'} [Sabā’: 49]. And the idols were falling on their faces. He performed his circuit on his riding animal, and he was not in a state of Ihrām (consecration) that day. He limited himself to the circuit. When he finished it, he called for 'Uthmān ibn Talhah, took the key of the Ka'bah from him, and ordered it to be opened. He entered it and saw images inside. He saw the images of Ibrāhīm and Ismā'īl (peace be upon them) seeking to know the unseen by drawing lots with arrows. He said: \"May Allah fight them! By Allah, they never sought to know the unseen by drawing lots with them! \" He saw a dove made of wood in the Ka'bah, broke it with his hand, and ordered the images to be erased. The Messenger (PBUH) prays in the Ka'bah and then addresses Quraysh Then he closed the door upon himself, Usāmah, and Bilāl. He faced the wall opposite the door until he was about three cubits away from it, where he stood, placing two pillars on his left, one pillar on his right, and three pillars behind him – the House had six pillars at that time – and then he prayed there. Then he went around the House, pronouncing the Takbīr (Allahu Akbar) in its corners and proclaiming the Oneness of Allah. Then he opened the door. Quraysh had filled the Mosque in rows, waiting to see what he would do. He took hold of the doorposts, and they were beneath him, and he said: \"There is no god but Allah alone, without any partner. He fulfilled His promise, helped His servant, and defeated the Confederates alone. Listen! Every claim of pride, or wealth, or blood [from the pre-Islamic era] is under these two feet of mine, except the custodianship of the House (Sidānah) and the watering of the pilgrims (Siqāyah). Listen! As for the slaying by mistake or quasi-intentional – by the whip or the stick – the blood money (Diyyah) for it is aggravated: one hundred camels, forty of which have their young in their wombs. O people of Quraysh! Allah has removed from you the arrogance (nakhwah) of the Jāhiliyyah and the boasting of ancestors. People are all from Adam, and Adam is from dust. \" Then he recited this verse: {O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.} No Reproach Upon You Today Then he said: \"O people of Quraysh, what do you think I shall do with you? \" They replied: \"Good, a noble brother and the son of a noble brother. \" He said: \"Then I say to you what Joseph said to his brothers: {No reproach upon you this day.} Go, for you are the freed ones! (at-Tulaqā') \" The Key of the House to its rightful keepers The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) then sat in the Mosque. 'Alī (may Allah be pleased with him) stood up with the key of the Ka'bah in his hand and said: \"Combine the custodianship (Hijābah) with the watering (Siqāyah) for us, may Allah bless you. \" – Another narration states that Al-'Abbās was the one who said this. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: \"Where is 'Uthmān ibn Talhah? \" He was called for, and the Prophet said to him: \"Here is your key, O 'Uthmān. Today is a day of goodness and faithfulness. \" In the narration of Ibn Sa'd in At-Tabaqāt, he said to him when handing him the key: \"Take it, eternally, hereditarily. No one will take it from you except an oppressor. O 'Uthmān, Allah has entrusted you with His House, so eat equitably from what reaches you from this House. \" Bilāl calls to prayer on the Ka'bah The time for prayer arrived. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) commanded Bilāl to ascend and call the prayer (Adhān) on the Ka'bah. Abū Sufyān ibn Harb, 'Attāb ibn Asīd, and Al-Hārith ibn Hishām were sitting in the courtyard of the Ka'bah. 'Attāb said: \"Allah honored Usayd [his father] by making him not hear this, lest he hear what would enrage him. \" Al-Hārith said: \"By Allah, if I knew it was the truth, I would follow it. \" Abū Sufyān said: \"As for me, by Allah, I will say nothing. If I spoke, these gravel stones would inform [the Prophet] about me. \" The Prophet (PBUH) then came out to them and said: \"I have known what you said. \" Then he mentioned it to them. Al-Hārith and 'Attāb said: \"We bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allah. By Allah, no one who was with us knew this for us to say he informed you. \" The Prayer of the Conquest (Salāt al-Fath) or Thanksgiving Prayer On that day, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) entered the house of Umm Hāni' bint Abī Tālib. He performed a full ritual wash (*ghusl*) and prayed eight units of prayer (rak'āt) in her house – it was in the forenoon (*duhā*). Some people thought it was the Duhā prayer, but it was the Prayer of the Conquest. Umm Hāni' had granted protection to two of her brothers-in-law. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: \"We have granted protection to whomever you have granted protection, O Umm Hāni'. \" Her brother, 'Alī ibn Abī Tālib, had intended to kill them. She had locked the door of her house upon them and had asked the Prophet (PBUH), who gave her that response. The Blood of Major Criminals is declared null On that day, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) declared the blood of nine individuals among the major criminals to be null (i.e., ordered their execution) and commanded that they be killed even if they were found clinging to the curtains of the Ka'bah. They were: 'Abd al-'Uzzā ibn Khatal, 'Abdullāh ibn Sa'd ibn Abī Sarh, 'Ikrimah ibn Abī Jahl, Al-Hārith ibn Nufayl ibn Wahb, Maqīs ibn Sabābah, Hubbār ibn al-Aswad, two singing slave women belonging to Ibn al-Khatal who used to sing in satire of the Prophet (PBUH), and Sārah, a freedwoman of Banū 'Abd al-Muttalib, who was the woman with whom Hātib's letter was found. As for Ibn Abī Sarh, 'Uthmān brought him to the Prophet (PBUH) and interceded for him. His life was spared, and his Islam was accepted after the Prophet (PBUH) remained silent, hoping that one of the Companions would rise and kill him. He had previously accepted Islam and emigrated, then apostatized and returned to Makkah. As for 'Ikrimah ibn Abī Jahl, he fled to Yemen. His wife sought amnesty for him, and the Prophet (PBUH) granted it. She followed him, and he returned with her, accepted Islam, and his Islam became good. As for Ibn Khatal, he was clinging to the curtains of the Ka'bah. A man came to the Prophet (PBUH) and informed him, and he said: \"Kill him, \" and he was killed. As for Maqīs ibn Sabābah, he was killed by Numaylah ibn 'Abdillāh. Maqīs had accepted Islam previously, then assaulted a man from the Helpers and killed him, then apostatized and joined the polytheists. As for Al-Hārith, he had severely harmed the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) in Makkah, and 'Alī killed him. As for Hubbār ibn al-Aswad, he was the one who had attacked Zaynab bint Rasūlillāh (the Prophet's daughter, PBUH) when she emigrated, prodding her [with his spear] so that she fell onto a rock and aborted her fetus. Hubbār fled on the day of Makkah, then accepted Islam, and his Islam became good. As for the two singing women, one was killed, and amnesty was sought for the other, and she accepted Islam, just as amnesty was sought for Sārah, and she accepted Islam. Ibn Hajar mentioned that Abū Ma'shar included among those whose blood was declared null Al-Hārith ibn Talātil al-Khuzā'ī, who was killed by 'Alī. Al-Hākim also mentioned among those whose blood was declared null Ka'b ibn Zuhayr – whose story is famous; he came later, accepted Islam, and recited praise – Wahshī ibn Harb, and Hind bint 'Utbah (Abū Sufyān's wife), who accepted Islam. Arnab, Ibn Khatal's freedwoman, was also killed, and Umm Sa'd was killed, according to Ibn Ishāq, completing the number to eight men and six women. It is possible that Arnab and Umm Sa'd were the two singing women, with a difference in their names or honorifics. The Conversion of Safwān ibn Umayyah and Fadālah ibn 'Umayr Safwān was not one of those whose blood was declared null, but as a major leader of Quraysh, he feared for himself and fled. 'Umayr ibn Wahb al-Jumahī sought amnesty for him from the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), who granted it and gave 'Umayr the turban with which he had entered Makkah. 'Umayr caught up with him as he was about to take a ship from Jeddah to Yemen and brought him back. Safwān said to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH): \"Grant me a choice of two months. \" The Prophet said: \"You have the choice of four months. \" Safwān later accepted Islam. His wife had accepted Islam before him, and he kept them in their original marriage. Fadālah was a bold man who came to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) while he was performing the Tawāf, intending to kill him. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) informed him of what was in his heart, and he accepted Islam. The Messenger's Second Sermon after the Conquest On the day after the Conquest, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) stood up to address the people. He praised Allah, extolled Him, and glorified Him as He deserves. Then he said: \"O people, Allah made Makkah sacred the day He created the heavens and the earth, and it is sacred by the sacredness of Allah until the Day of Resurrection. It is not lawful for any man who believes in Allah and the Last Day to shed blood in it or to cut down any tree in it. If anyone offers the fighting of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) as an excuse, say: 'Allah granted permission to His Messenger, but He did not grant it to you.' It was made lawful for me for only one hour of a single day, and its sanctity has returned today as it was yesterday. Let the one present inform the one absent. \" In another narration: \"Its thorns are not to be cut, its game is not to be disturbed, its fallen property is not to be picked up except by one who announces it, and its fresh herbage is not to be cut. \" Al-'Abbās said: \"O Messenger of Allah, except the Idhkhir (aromatic grass), for it is for their artisans and their homes. \" He said: \"Except the Idhkhir. \" That day, Khuzā'ah had killed a man from Banū Layth for revenge dating back to the Jāhiliyyah. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said in this regard: \"O people of Khuzā'ah, withdraw your hands from killing. Killing has multiplied if it were beneficial. You have killed a man, and I will pay the blood money for him. Whoever kills after my standing here, his family has the choice of two options: either the blood of his killer, or the blood money (Diyyah). \" In a narration: A man from Yemen called Shāh stood up and said: \"Write [this speech] for me, O Messenger of Allah. \" The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: \"Write [it down] for Abū Shāh. \" The Concern of the Helpers about the Messenger (PBUH) staying in Makkah When the Conquest of Makkah was completed for the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) – which was his city, his homeland, and his birthplace – the Helpers (Ansār) said among themselves: \"Do you think the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), now that Allah has opened his land and his city to him, will remain there? \" – He was supplicating on As-Safā, raising his hands. When he finished his supplication, he asked: \"What did you say? \" They replied: \"Nothing, O Messenger of Allah. \" He persisted until they informed him. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: \"I seek refuge in Allah! The life is your life, and the death is your death. \" Taking the Allegiance (Bay'ah) When Allah opened Makkah to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and the Muslims, the truth became clear to the people of Makkah. They knew that there was no way to success except through Islam. They submitted to it and gathered for the allegiance. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sat on As-Safā, taking the allegiance of the people, with 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb sitting below him, taking the allegiance from the people. They pledged allegiance to him to listen and obey within their capability. In Al-Madārik, it is narrated that when the Prophet (PBUH) finished taking the allegiance from the men, he began taking the allegiance from the women while he was on As-Safā, and 'Umar was sitting below him, taking their allegiance on his behalf and conveying his words to them. Hind bint 'Utbah, Abū Sufyān's wife, came, disguised, fearing that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) would recognize her because of what she had done to Hamzah. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: \"I take your allegiance that you will not associate anything with Allah. \" 'Umar took the allegiance from the women that they would not associate anything with Allah. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: \"Nor will you steal. \" Hind said: \"Abū Sufyān is a miserly man. Will I be committing a sin if I take some of his wealth to feed our family? \" Abū Sufyān said: \"Whatever you have taken is lawful for you. \" The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) laughed and recognized her, saying: \"And you are Hind? \" She replied: \"Yes. Forgive what has passed, O Prophet of Allah, may Allah forgive you. \" The Prophet said: \"Nor will you commit unlawful sexual intercourse. \" She said: \"Does a free woman commit unlawful sexual intercourse? \" The Prophet said: \"Nor will you kill your children. \" She said: \"We raised them small, and you killed them big – you and they know best. \" – Her son, Hanzalah ibn Abī Sufyān, had been killed at Badr. 'Umar laughed until he lay on his back, and the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) smiled. The Prophet said: \"Nor will you produce a slander. \" She said: \"By Allah, slander is an ugly thing, and you only command us to righteousness and noble manners. \" The Prophet said: \"Nor will you disobey me in what is right. \" She said: \"By Allah, we did not sit in this assembly with the intention of disobeying you. \" When she returned, she began breaking her idol and saying: \"We were in delusion because of you. \" In the Sahīh: Hind bint 'Utbah came and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, there was no people of a tent on the face of the earth whom I loved more to see humbled than the people of your tent, and today there is no people of a tent on the face of the earth whom I love more to see honored than the people of your tent. \" The Prophet said: \"And likewise, by Him in Whose Hand is my soul. \" She said: \"O Messenger of Allah, Abū Sufyān is a stingy man. Is there any blame on me for feeding our children from what belongs to him? \" He said: \"No, only what is reasonable (bil-ma'rūf). \" The Messenger's Stay in Makkah and his work there The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) stayed in Makkah for nineteen days, renewing the landmarks of Islam and guiding the people to right guidance and piety. During these days, he commanded Abū Usayd al-Khuzā'ī to renew the boundary markers of the Sanctuary. He dispatched his detachments (*sarāyā*) to call people to Islam and to break the idols that were around Makkah. They were all broken. His caller announced in Makkah: \"Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should not leave an idol in his house without breaking it. \" The Detachments and Missions 1. After the Conquest, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sent Khālid ibn al-Walīd to Al-'Uzzā five nights before the end of Ramadān in 8 AH to demolish it. It was at Nakhlah and belonged to Quraysh and all Banū Kinānah; it was their greatest idol. Its custodians were the Banū Shaybān. Khālid went out to it with thirty horsemen until he reached it, and he demolished it. When he returned, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) asked him: \"Did you see anything? \" He replied: \"No. \" The Prophet said: \"Then you did not demolish it. Go back to it and demolish it. \" Khālid returned, angry, drawing his sword. A naked black woman with disheveled hair came out to him. The custodian began to shout at her. Khālid struck her and cleaved her into two. Then he returned to inform the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), who said: \"Yes, that was Al-'Uzzā. She has despaired of ever being worshipped in your land. \" 2. Then, in the same month, he sent 'Amr ibn al-'Ās to demolish Suwā'. It was an idol of Hudhail at Ruhāt, about 150 km northeast of Makkah. When 'Amr reached it, its custodian asked him: \"What do you want? \" 'Amr replied: \"The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) has commanded me to demolish it. \" The custodian said: \"You will not be able to do that. \" 'Amr asked: \"Why? \" The custodian said: \"It will prevent you. \" 'Amr said: \"Are you still in falsehood? Woe to you, does it hear or see? \" Then he approached and broke it, and commanded his companions to demolish its treasury house, but they found nothing in it. He then said to the custodian: \"How do you see it now? \" The custodian replied: \"I have submitted to Allah. \" 3. In the same month, he sent Sa'd ibn Zayd al-Ashhalī with twenty horsemen to Manāt. It was at Al-Mushallal, near Qudayd, and belonged to the Aws, Khazraj, Ghassān, and others. When Sa'd reached it, its custodian asked him: \"What do you want? \" Sa'd replied: \"To demolish Manāt. \" The custodian said: \"That is your affair. \" Sa'd approached it, and a naked black woman with disheveled hair came out, wailing and beating her chest. The custodian said to her: \"Manāt is before you! [Here are] some of your disobedient ones! \" Sa'd struck and killed her, then he approached the idol, demolished it, and broke it. They found nothing in its treasury. 4. When Khālid ibn al-Walīd returned from demolishing Al-'Uzzā, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sent him in Shawwāl of the same year – 8 AH – to the Banū Judhaymah as a caller to Islam, not a fighter. He set out with three hundred and fifty men from the Emigrants, the Helpers, and Banū Sulaym. When he reached them, he invited them to Islam, but they did not know how to say: * \"We have accepted Islam (Aslamnā), \"* and they started saying: * \"We have become Sābi'ūn (Saba'nā), we have become Sābi'ūn. \"* Khālid began to kill and capture them. He assigned a captive to every man in his group. One day, he commanded every man to kill his captive, but Ibn 'Umar and his companions refused, until they came to the Prophet (PBUH) and informed him. The Prophet (PBUH) raised his hands and said: \"O Allah, I disavow myself of what Khālid has done, \" twice. It was the Banū Sulaym who killed their captives, not the Emigrants and the Helpers. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sent 'Alī to pay the blood money for their slain and what they had lost. A dispute and ill feeling arose about this between Khālid and 'Abd ar-Rahmān ibn 'Awf. When the news reached the Prophet (PBUH), he said: \"Be gentle, O Khālid! Leave my companions! By Allah, if one of you had a mountain of gold and spent it in the way of Allah, you would not reach the merit of a mere morning or evening of a man from my companions. \" That was the expedition of the Conquest of Makkah, the decisive battle and the Greatest Conquest that brought a definitive end to the existence of paganism and left no room or justification for its survival in the Arabian Peninsula. Most tribes were waiting to see what would result from the struggle and confrontation that was taking place between the Muslims and the pagans. Those tribes knew well that the Sanctuary (al-Haram) could only be controlled by one who was upon the truth. This firm belief had been confirmed to them half a century earlier when the People of the Elephant intended this House and were destroyed, made like pulverized straw. The Treaty of Al-Hudaybiyyah was a prelude and preparation for this Great Conquest. Through it, people felt safe, talked to each other, and debated Islam. The Muslims who had been hiding in Makkah were able to openly practice their religion, call to it, and debate it. Many people entered Islam because of it, so much so that the number of the Muslim army, which had not exceeded three thousand in previous expeditions, swelled to ten thousand in this expedition. This decisive expedition opened people's eyes and removed the last veils that separated them from Islam. With this Conquest, the Muslims gained total control over both the political and religious situation across the length and breadth of the Arabian Peninsula. Religious primacy and temporal leadership were transferred to them. The phase that had begun after the Treaty of Al-Hudaybiyyah, favorable to the Muslims, was completed and perfected by this Manifest Conquest. Another phase began after that, which was entirely in favor of the Muslims, giving them total control of the situation. All that remained for the Arab peoples was to come to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) to embrace Islam and carry its call to the world, for which their readiness was completed in the next two years. The Farewell Pilgrimage (Hajjat al-Wada') The work of calling to Islam and conveying the message was complete, and a new society had been built on the foundation of affirming the sole Divinity of Allah and negating it for anyone else, and on the foundation of the message of Muhammad (PBUH). It was as if a hidden voice arose in the heart of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), informing him that his time in this world was drawing to a close. Indeed, when he sent Mu'ādh to Yemen in 10 AH, he said to him – among other things –: \"O Mu'ādh, it is likely that you will not meet me after this year of mine, and perhaps you will pass by this mosque of mine and my grave. \" Mu'ādh wept, moved by the separation from the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). Allah willed for His Messenger (PBUH) to see the fruits of his call, for which he had endured various hardships for more than twenty years. Individuals and representatives of the Arab tribes gathered around Makkah. They received from him the laws and rulings of the religion, and he received from them the testimony that he had delivered the trust, conveyed the message, and advised the nation. The Prophet (PBUH) announced his intention for this accepted and witnessed pilgrimage. Many people came to Al-Madīnah, all seeking to follow the example of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). On Saturday, five days before the end of Dhū al-Qa'dah, the Prophet (PBUH) prepared for the journey: he combed his hair, anointed himself with oil, put on his *izār* (lower garment) and *ridā'* (upper garment), marked his sacrificial animals (*budn*), and set out after noon, reaching Dhū al-Hulayfah before the 'Asr prayer. He prayed it as two units and stayed there overnight. In the morning, he said to his Companions: \"A visitor from my Lord came to me last night and said: 'Pray in this blessed valley and say: an 'Umrah within a Hajj.' \" Before he prayed the Zuhr prayer, he performed a full ritual wash (*ghusl*) for his Ihrām. 'Ā'ishah perfumed him with her hands with *dharīrah* (fragrant powder) and perfume containing musk, on his body and head, so much so that the glint of the perfume was visible in the parting of his hair and his beard. He kept it and did not wash it off. Then he put on his *izār* and *ridā'*, prayed the Zuhr in two units, and then declared his intention for Hajj and 'Umrah at his place of prayer, combining them (Qirān). Then he set out, rode Al-Qaswā', and declared his intention again, and then again when the mule stood up with him on Al-Baydā'. He continued his journey until he drew near Makkah. He spent the night at Dhū Tuwā, then entered Makkah after the Fajr prayer and performing *ghusl*, on the morning of Sunday, four nights into Dhū al-Hijjah in 10 AH – he had spent eight nights on the road, which is the average distance. When he entered the Sacred Mosque, he performed the circuit (Tawāf) around the House and the running (*Sa'y*) between As-Safā and Al-Marwah. He did not exit the Ihrām because he was performing Qirān and had brought his sacrificial animals (*Hady*) with him. He camped in the upper part of Makkah at Al-Hajūn and stayed there, not returning to perform any circuit other than the circuit of Hajj. He ordered those of his Companions who had not brought sacrificial animals (*Hady*) to make their Ihrām an 'Umrah, to perform the Tawāf around the House and the Sa'y between As-Safā and Al-Marwah, and then to exit the Ihrām completely. They hesitated, and he said: \"If I could undo what I have done, I would not have brought the sacrificial animals, and if I did not have the Hady with me, I would have exited the Ihrām. \" So, those who did not have the Hady exited the Ihrām, listening and obeying. On the eighth day of Dhū al-Hijjah – Yawm at-Tarwiyah – he proceeded to Minā. He prayed the Zuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib, 'Ishā', and Fajr prayers there – five prayers – and then stayed a short time.",

  "texte_original":"In this chapter, we speak about Lot, the Prophet of God and His Messenger. God, Blessed and Exalted, has linked the story of Lot with the story of Abraham in many places in His Noble Book, mentioning that Lot believed in Abraham and indicated that he migrated with him, as it says: “So Lot trusted in him.” [Al-Ankabut: 26]. As I mentioned earlier, Lot was sent to the people of Sodom and the surrounding areas of the Jordan, while the Friend of God (Abraham) remained in Palestine. The people of Sodom and its towns were among the most disbelieving and corrupt of God’s creation. They innovated in immorality in ways no one before them had done. They combined polytheism with corruption, cutting off the path, committing sins openly, and engaging in abominations in their gatherings. Lot came to them to call them to their Lord and to forbid them from their falsehood, but they did not respond and persisted in their sins, despite warnings of God’s punishment if they continued [Al-Qur’an: Al-Naml]. Some of them said to one another: “Expel Lot and his family from your city; they are people who purify themselves,” as if, because impurity had dominated their hearts, they considered purity a shameful act. [Al-Ankabut: 56]. They said to Lot: “We will punish you with God’s torment if you are among the truthful.” He said: “My Lord, help me against the corrupting people” [Al-Ankabut: 29]. When Lot despaired of them, God sent angels to Abraham to give him the glad tidings of Isaac, and after Isaac, Jacob. They were commanded to overturn the towns of Lot’s people after instructing Lot to leave his home. The angels came to Sodom in the form of men of the most handsome of God’s creation. The people of Lot came to them hastily, intending evil. Lot was alarmed and said to his people: “Fear God and do not disgrace my guests. Is there not among you a righteous man?” [Hud: 78]. “Your women are better for you and purer.” They said: “O Lot, you know our desire is for men, and we have no desire for women.” Lot’s anger intensified, and he said to them: “If only I had the strength against you” [Hud: 80], meaning to destroy you, “but I take refuge in God; whoever takes refuge in Him has taken refuge in a strong protector.” At that point, the guests revealed to him that they were angels, the messengers of God sent to destroy his people. It is mentioned that Gabriel, after reassuring Lot that they would not harm him, struck out the eyes of his people, blinding them. They said to Lot: “Do not fear, nor grieve; indeed, we will save you and your family, except your wife, she is among the doomed” [Al-Ankabut: 33]. They instructed him: “Take your family by night and follow them not” [Al-Hijr: 65]. They brought glad tidings that the rest of these people would be destroyed [Al-Hijr: 66]. Lot and his daughters departed, and God saved them from the painful punishment. The angels overturned the land of Lot’s people, sending a shower from above and a quake from beneath, and their land was turned over as their nature had been. God left a clear sign to this day, known to the people of the Arabian Peninsula when they visit or return from the Levant, as God says: “And indeed, you pass by them by morning and evening. Do you not reflect?” [As-Saffat: 137-138]. God made Lot’s wife an example for every disbeliever until the Day of Judgment, as He says: “God sets forth an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two of Our righteous servants, but they betrayed them. Nothing of God could benefit them, and it was said: Enter the Fire with those who enter” [At-Tahrim: 10]. As I explained earlier, the betrayal of Noah’s wife and Lot’s wife was not marital infidelity, but disbelief in God and opposition to His messengers, peace be upon them. God, Blessed and Exalted, narrated Lot’s story in several places in His Noble Book, as in Surah Al-A’raf: “Lot said to his people: ‘Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people.’ The answer of his people was nothing but to say: ‘Expel them from your city; they are people who purify themselves.’ So We saved him and his family, except his wife, who was of the doomed. And We rained upon them a rain, and see how was the end of the criminals” [Al-A’raf: 80-84]. And in Surah Hud: “And Our messengers came to Abraham with the good news. They said, ‘Peace.’ He said, ‘Peace,’ and soon after they brought a roasted calf. When he saw their hands could not reach it, he was suspicious and feared them. They said: ‘Do not fear. We have been sent to a people of Lot, and his wife is doomed.’ She laughed, but We gave her glad tidings of Isaac, and after Isaac, Jacob. She said, ‘Woe to me! How shall I have a son, when I am old, and my husband is old?’ They said: ‘Do you marvel at God’s command? God’s mercy and blessings be upon you, O family! Indeed, it is something wondrous and praiseworthy.’ When the fear left Abraham and the glad tidings reached him, they spoke to us concerning Lot’s people. Abraham was forbearing, gentle, and patient. He said: ‘Turn away from this; indeed, your Lord’s command has come, and punishment is inevitable for them.’” [Hud: 69]. When Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed and constrained by them. He said: “This is a difficult day.” His people rushed toward him, having previously committed evil deeds. He said: “O my people! These [women] are purer for you. So fear God and do not disgrace my guest. Is there not among you a wise man?” They said: “You know we have no right to your daughters, and you know what we desire.” He said: “If only I had strength against you or could take refuge in a strong protector.” They said: “O Lot, we are messengers of your Lord; they will not reach you. So take your family by night, and let no one of you look back, except your wife, who is doomed.” The command came at dawn, and We rained stones upon them, firmly marked by your Lord. They were not far from the wrongdoers [Hud: 69]. And in Surah Al-Hijr: “We told Our servants: I am the Forgiving, the Merciful, and My punishment is the painful punishment. When they came to Abraham, they said: ‘Peace.’ He said: ‘Indeed, we are wary of you.’ They said: ‘Do not fear. We bring you glad tidings of a knowledgeable boy.’ He said: ‘How can you bring me glad tidings in old age?’ They said: ‘We bring you the truth. Do not be among the despairing.’ He said: ‘Who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except the lost?’ They said: ‘We have been sent to a criminal people, except for Lot; We will save him and his family, except his wife, who is among the doomed.’ When Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed by them and constrained. They said: ‘Do not fear nor grieve. We will save you and your family, except your wife, who is among the doomed. Indeed, We are sending upon the people of this town a punishment from the sky for what they were corrupting. And We have left a clear sign in it for a people who understand.’” [Al-Ankabut: 28-35]. And in Surah As-Saffat: “Indeed, Lot was among the messengers. When We saved him and his family, except his wife, We destroyed the others. Indeed, you pass by them by morning and evening. Do you not reflect?” [As-Saffat: 133-138]. And in Surah Adh-Dhariyat: “They asked: ‘What is your matter, O messengers?’ They said: ‘We have been sent to a criminal people to send upon them stones of clay, marked with your Lord, for the transgressors. We have brought out whoever was in it of the believers, leaving a clear sign for those who fear the painful punishment.’” [Adh-Dhariyat: 31-37]. And in Surah An-Najm: “And the immoral woman fell; what she fell into, she was covered by it.” [An-Najm: 30]. And in Surah Al-Qamar: “The people of Lot denied the warnings. We sent upon them a rain, except for Lot and his family, as a favor from Us. Thus, We reward the grateful. And We warned them, but they disputed the warnings. We blotted out their eyes; let them taste My punishment and warnings. In the morning, the punishment was settled; let them taste My punishment and warnings. And We have made the Qur’an easy for remembrance; is there any who will remember?” [Al-Qamar: 33-40]. Some people misunderstood Lot’s words: “Or I take refuge in a strong protector” [Hud: 80] to mean he sought protection in a powerful tribe. This is incorrect. In Sahih al-Bukhari, Abu Huraira reported that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “God forgave Lot because he took refuge in a strong protector,” meaning God. When Lot took refuge in God, God protected him. The angels then said: “O Lot, indeed, We are messengers of your Lord; they will not reach you” [Hud: 81]. Many animals also avoid the act of approaching males. Abdul Malik ibn Marwan, the Umayyad Caliph, said: “If God had not mentioned it in the Qur’an, I would not have thought a male would approach another male.” The term “Lotite” became widespread for those committing this act, but this is incorrect. The act should not be attributed to Lot. Similarly, Abu Jahl and Abu Lahab are not called Muhammads, as they opposed Muhammad. Lot’s name represents righteousness, not this crime. God said about Lot: “Indeed, I am disgusted by your deeds” [Ash-Shu’ara: 168]. As for the story in Genesis 9 about Lot and his daughters, God cleared Lot and his daughters of any wrongdoing, peace be upon him",

  "texte_original":"In this chapter, we speak about two honorable prophets of God, namely Idris and Elias (peace be upon them). Al-Bukhari, in his Sahih, indicated that Idris is Elias, saying: it is narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud and Ibn ‘Abbas that Elias is Idris. Al-Bukhari also noted that people differ regarding Idris’s lineage. In his Sahih, in the chapter mentioning Idris, it is said that he is the ancestor of the father of Noah, and some say he is the ancestor of Noah. However, Al-Bukhari did not assert any specific lineage for Idris, nor is there any authentic report from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) confirming that Idris lived before Noah. The judge Abu Bakr Ibn al-Arabi held that Idris was not an ancestor of Noah, but rather belonged to the Children of Israel, based on the idea that Idris is Elias, and Elias is one of the prophets of the Children of Israel. This view is supported by what Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih regarding the Isra and Mi‘raj. When Gabriel passed by the Prophet with Idris, he said: “Welcome, righteous brother and righteous prophet.” The Prophet asked: “Who is this?” He was told: “This is Idris.” In another version via Qatada, it is said: he ascended until he reached the fourth heaven and asked: “Who is this?” Gabriel said: “Muhammad is with him.” They said: “Welcome to him, and what a good arrival!” The Prophet met Idris, returned his greeting, and Gabriel said: “Welcome, righteous brother and righteous prophet.” The term “righteous brother” indicates that the Prophet was not from his lineage. If Idris had been an ancestor of Noah, the Prophet would certainly have been from his lineage, and he would have been addressed as Adam and Abraham were in the Isra and Mi‘raj: “Welcome, righteous son and righteous prophet.” Whether Idris lived before or after Noah is not of great importance. Therefore, there is no specific report confirming the exact date or period of his mission. What matters is that he is a prophet of God, elevated to a high rank, and that he was truthful and a prophet. God says about him: \"And mention Idris in the Book. Indeed, he was a truthful prophet. And We raised him to a high station.\" [Maryam: 56-57] And He also says: \"And Ishmael, and Idris, and Dhul-Kifl: all were among the righteous. We admitted them into Our mercy; indeed, they were of the virtuous.\" [Al-Anbiya: 85-86] Many commentators and narrators have reported various legends about Idris. They claimed that he asked an angel to intercede with the Angel of Death to postpone taking his soul so he could continue his work. The angel carried him on his wings up to the sky. When he reached the fourth heaven, the Angel of Death met him and spoke to him. The Angel asked where Idris was; he replied: “He is on my back.” The angel was astonished and said: “I was told to take Idris’s soul in the fourth heaven; how can I do that while he is on earth?” Yet his soul was taken there. Many other “firsts” are attributed to Idris: he is said to be the first to write with a pen, the first to sew clothes, and the first to write in the sand. Ibn Kathir in Stories of the Prophets reports that many exegetes and scholars claim he was the first to speak on this matter and call him Hermes Trismegistus. They also falsely attributed many things to him, as they did with other prophets, scholars, wise men, and saints. As for Elias, the Quran clearly indicates that he is of the lineage of Noah. God says in Surah Al-An‘am: \"We guided Noah before, and from his descendants, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, as well as the righteous, Zechariah, John, Jesus, and Elias: all were among the righteous.\" [Al-An‘am: 84-85] This indicates that Elias comes from Noah’s lineage, whether we say the pronoun “his descendants” refers to Noah or Abraham, since Abraham is from Noah’s lineage. Therefore, anyone from Abraham’s lineage is necessarily from Noah’s lineage. God mentions Elias in Surah Al-An‘am and recounts his story in Surah As-Saffat. This story illustrates his mission: calling to God, purifying worship, urging his people to piety, and warning them of the causes of God’s wrath. Only turning to God, following His commands, and avoiding His prohibitions protects them from His punishment. Elias condemned the worship of their idol Baal, showing them that it does not deserve sanctification or honor. God supported Elias in the truth and helped him against his disbelieving people. He left a good legacy and beautiful praise for himself and for those who believed in him, as well as for other prophets and nations until the Day of Judgment. God says: \"And indeed, Elias was among the messengers. He said to his people: Do you not fear? Why do you call upon Baal and abandon the best Creator, God, your Lord and the Lord of your ancestors? They denied him, except for the sincere servants of God. We left peace upon him among the later generations. Peace be upon Elias! Thus do We reward the righteous; indeed, he was among Our believing servants.\" [As-Saffat: 123-132] This story strengthens the heart of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and serves as a lesson for the wise: a good outcome belongs to the righteous servants of God, while a bad outcome belongs to the deniers and the misguided. Elias is a Hebrew name, which can be given the suffix -in or -on, hence Eliasin, just as Idris becomes Idresin. Most of the seven principal reciters of the Quran say “Peace be upon Eliasin.” This could mean Elias alone with the added suffix, or Elias along with the believers with him. Ibn Kathir also mentions that some claimed that Elias and Al-Khidr meet every year in Jerusalem during Ramadan and drink from Zamzam water sufficient for the next year, but he clarifies that none of this is authentic and that evidence indicates that both Al-Khidr and Elias died.",

  "texte_original":"## Chapter Thirty-Six: Stories of the Prophets: The True Narrative: Shu'aib We speak to you about Shu'aib, the Prophet and Messenger of Allah, who is described as the Orator of the Prophets (peace be upon them). Most scholars trace his lineage back to Ibrahim, the Friend of the All-Merciful (peace be upon them), while some mention that he was from the ancient Arabs (Al-'Aribah). Allah sent him to his people, Madyan (Midian), who lived in the land known by their name near Ma'an, on the outskirts of the Levant, close to the land of the Hijaz. This land was near the lake of the people of Lut, known as the Dead Sea, and lay on a route traveled by Arabs to the Levant, as well as a path used by travelers between Egypt, the Levant, and the Hijaz, close to the Gulf of Aqaba. It is apparent that they lived not long after the destruction of the people of Lut, as their land was not far from the villages of the people of Lut. The people of Madyan were disbelievers who cut off the way (highway robbers) and intimidated passersby. They worshipped deities besides Allah, including Al-Aykah, which was a tree or a dense grove. They were also among the worst in dealings and transgression against wealth, giving short measure and weight, defrauding people of their goods, and spreading corruption in the land after its reform. They took every crooked path and deviated from the straight path. Allah called them Madyan, after their tribe, and also described them as The Companions of the Wood (Ahl al-Aykah). The claim that Shu'aib was sent to two different nations is a refuted opinion and unsound understanding, for Madyan are the Companions of the Wood. Allah says (Al-A'raf, 7:85): \"And to Madyan [We sent] their brother, Shu'aib, \" and concerning the Companions of the Wood (Ash-Shu'ara, 26:177): \"When Shu'aib said to them, \" omitting 'their brother' because Shu'aib was not a part of their worship of Al-Aykah, though they are the same people. The total descriptions given of the people of Madyan are the same as those given of the Companions of the Wood. Allah sent Shu'aib to Madyan, the Companions of the Wood, and he was from a noble lineage. He called them to dedicate their worship solely to Allah, commanded them to give full measure and weight, not to defraud people of their goods, to abandon corruption in the land, not to cut off the road, and to adhere to justice, explaining that what is with Allah is better and more lasting. He clarified that he did not ask for any wage for conveying the Message. He warned them that if they denied him, they would be afflicted by the fate of the people of Nuh, or Hud, or Salih (Hud 11:89), reminding them of the people of Lut, whose destruction was recent and nearby. The Quran narrates the story of Madyan immediately after the story of Lut in Al-A'raf, Hud, Al-Hijr, and Ash-Shu'ara. Shu'aib reminded them of Allah’s favor in having increased their small numbers. The response of his people was only to mock him and his prayer. They said (Ash-Shu'ara 26:185-186): \"You are only one of the bewitched, and you are only a human being like us. \" They questioned: \"O Shu'aib, does your prayer command you that we should abandon the worship of our ancestral idols? And does your prayer restrict our freedom to dispose of our wealth as we wish—by theft, usury, or short measure? \" Shu'aib replied that Allah had guided him to this religion which leads to the straight path. \"I am the first of the believers committed to this religion, and I do not intend to differ from you in that which I forbid you (Hud 11:88). I only desire reform as much as I am able. And my success is not but through Allah. Upon Him I have relied, and to Him I return \" (Hud 11:88). Following his clear call, they said to him: \"O Shu'aib, we do not understand much of what you say. We see you among us as weak, and were it not for your clan (Raht), we would have certainly stoned you. \" Shu'aib asked them: \"Is my clan more honored in your hearts than Allah? \" A group believed, angering the disbelievers, who threatened to expel Shu'aib and the believers if they did not revert, saying (Al-A'raf 7:90): \"If you follow Shu'aib, indeed, you will then be losers. \" Shu'aib and the believers refused: \"We would have invented a lie about Allah if we returned to your religion after Allah has saved us from it.... Our Lord encompasses all things in knowledge. Upon Allah we have relied. Our Lord, judge between us and our people in truth, and You are the best of those who give judgment \" (Al-A'raf 7:89). The word 'returned' (Aada - عاد) here signifies 'to become' (Saara - صار). The people of Shu'aib hastened the punishment, demanding Shu'aib cause fragments of the sky to fall upon them if he was truthful. He explained that punishment was solely in Allah's hand. He then challenged them: \"Act according to your position (exert your efforts); indeed, I am acting (doing my duty). You are going to know upon whom the humiliating punishment will descend and who is a liar. And wait; indeed, I am waiting with you \" (Hud 11:93). When the Command of Allah came, He saved Shu'aib and the believers by His mercy. The disbelievers were seized by a Rajfah (quaking\/earthquake), a Sayhah (loud cry\/blast), and the Dhillah (shade\/cloud) rained down Allah's torment. They became in their homes motionless corpses (Jathimeen), perished, as if they had never lived there. Ruin for Madyan, just as Thamud perished. Allah narrated Shu'aib's story in detail in Al-A'raf, Hud, and Ash-Shu'ara, and briefly in Al-Ankabut and Al-Hijr. --- ## Chapter Thirty-Seven: Shu'aib (Continued) Refutation of the Confusion with Musa's Father-in-Law Many scholars have erred by claiming that Shu'aib is the old man who gave his daughter in marriage to Musa (Moses) when Musa fled to Madyan (Al-Qasas 28:20-29). Shu'aib preceded Musa (peace be upon him) by many centuries and distant times. Musa's arrival in Madyan and his marriage to the daughter of a righteous old man does not necessitate that this man was Shu'aib. No authentic Prophetic report confirms this. Rather, the Quran indicates that Allah sent Musa many centuries after the destruction of Shu'aib's people (Al-A'raf 7:101-103; Al-Qasas 28:43). Shu'aib had told his people (Hud 11:89): \"And the people of Lut are not far from you. \" The nations of Lut were destroyed during the lifetime of Ibrahim, the Friend of the All-Merciful, separating them from Musa by many generations. The man who married Musa's daughter was a righteous believer, from the offspring of those believers whom Allah saved from Shu'aib's people. And Allah knows best. The context of the Quran's narrative indicates that the greatest crime of Shu'aib's people, after Shirk, was giving short measure and weight, serving as a severe warning against this transgression. Thus, Allah says (Al-Mutaffifin 83:1-6): \"Woe to the defrauders [Al-Mutaffifin]! Those who, when they take a measure from people, take in full. But if they give by measure or by weight to them, they cause loss. Do those not think that they will be resurrected for a tremendous Day - The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds? \" To the next chapter, if Allah wills. Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.",

  "texte_original":"Zechariah and John We speak to you about two noble Messengers of God who hastened in good deeds, calling upon God with hope and fear, and who were humble before Him: Zechariah (Zakariyya) and John (Yahya). Allah the Almighty mentioned Zechariah and John in the Holy Quran a few years after the Prophet's mission (peace and blessings be upon him). Surah Maryam (Mary) begins with their narrative; it was revealed before the migration of Ja'far ibn Abi Talib and his companions to Abyssinia. Allah (Blessed and Exalted is He) also mentioned Zechariah and John in Surah Al-Anbiya (The Prophets), which is also Meccan, as well as in Surah Al-An'am (The Cattle) among the group of Messengers (also Meccan), and in Surah Al Imran (The Family of Imran), which is Medinan. The mention of them in Surahs Maryam, Al-Anbiya, and Al Imran serves to demonstrate Allah's Power over all things, that nothing in the heavens or on earth can frustrate Him. The laws of the universe operate by His Will, not by their own natures, for He is the Lord, Master, and Sovereign of all things, and the Overseer of His servants' affairs. He supports His allies, answers their prayers, grants them victory over their enemies, and ensures a good outcome for them, thus strengthening the heart of the Messenger of Allah and the believers with him. Indeed, He created Adam without a father or mother, Eve (Hawwa') without a mother, and Jesus (Isa) without a father. He granted a son to Abraham (Ibrahim) when he was an old man and his elderly wife had passed the age of menopause, a state in which women do not usually conceive. Similarly, He granted His righteous servant Zechariah his son John, when Zechariah had reached an advanced old age (i.e., his bones were weakened and his head was covered with grey hair), a manifestation of man's transformation from strength to weakness, as Allah states: *« Then, after strength, He appointed weakness and grey hair... »* [Surah Ar-Rum (30:54)]. Despite Zechariah reaching this advanced state of age, his wife was barren in her youth; she did not conceive in her younger years and had now become an old woman, combining two factors that conventionally prevent pregnancy. The context of the Noble Quran suggests that Zechariah was deeply concerned with the righteousness of the Children of Israel, that he witnessed their obstinacy (as was their custom) after the death of the Prophets and Messengers, and that he feared their deviation from the Straight Path would intensify. His bones were weak and he had reached an advanced age, and he saw no one among his people fit to carry the Message after him. Since his wife was barren, it was unconventional for a woman in her condition to give birth, which caused him great anxiety. His wife was the sister of Mary (Maryam) bint Imran, the mother of Jesus (Isa) son of Mary, or her maternal aunt. After Mary's father died, the Children of Israel disputed over who would be her guardian; they drew lots, and the lot fell to Zechariah. He took her under his guardianship and placed her in his sanctuary (Mihrab). He noticed that whenever he entered her place of worship, he found sustenance with her. He said: *« O Mary, from where is this for you? » She said: « It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without reckoning. »* [Surah Al Imran (3:37]. The implications of this reality quickly arose in his heart, making him hope that God would bestow upon him a righteous son to govern the Children of Israel. Even though the conventional causes for his righteous wife to bear a son were absent—he was an old man and she was barren—the sustenance that God had granted Mary stirred hope in him that God would grant him a child despite the absence of normal means. So he called upon his Lord in a low voice, standing in prayer in his sanctuary (Mihrab). In his supplication, he said: *« My Lord, grant me from Yourself a good offspring. Indeed, You are the Hearer of supplication. »* He also said: *« My Lord, indeed my bones have weakened and my head is covered with grey hair, and never have I been wretched in my supplication to You, my Lord. And indeed, I fear my relatives after me (those who will inherit my responsibility); moreover, my wife was barren in her youth, yet You are powerful over all things. So grant me from Yourself an ally (a son) who will inherit me and inherit from the family of Jacob (Yaqub), and make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased. »* Then the angels called out to him while he was standing in prayer in the *Mihrab* (sanctuary), announcing that God gave him the good news of a boy whose name would be John (Yahya), for whom God had not made anyone similar before. He would be a confirmer of a Word from God, a chief (Sayyid), chaste (Hasoor), and a Prophet among the righteous. He asked, « How can I have a child when my wife and I are in this state? » The angel replied, « Thus it is; Allah creates what He wills. Indeed, He created you before when you were nothing – you came into your mother's womb as a fluid with no human form. » He then asked Allah for a sign by which he would know that the child was imminent. The answer was: « Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to people for three days, while perfectly sound (with no illness). » He emerged from his sanctuary to his people and indicated to them to glorify God morning and evening. God granted him John, who grew up quickly. Allah granted him wisdom and Judgment while yet a child (Hukm Sabiya), favored him with many gifts, and granted him Peace (Salam) on the day he was born, the day he dies, and the day he is raised alive. Concerning this, Allah says in Surah Maryam (19:1-15): *« Kãf-Hã-Yã-'Ayn-Sãd. A mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zechariah. When he called upon his Lord in a secret invocation... »* until *« ... And peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive. »* And He says in Surah Al-Anbiya (21:89-90): *« And (mention) Zechariah, when he cried out to his Lord, « My Lord, do not leave me solitary, and You are the best of inheritors. » So We responded to him, and We bestowed upon him John (Yahya), and We made his wife fit for him. Indeed, they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate to Us with hope and fear, and they were humble before Us. »* And in Surah Al-An'am (6:85): *« And Zechariah and John and Jesus and Elias. All were among the righteous. »* And in Surah Al Imran (3:37-40): *« So her Lord accepted her with a good acceptance and made her grow in a good manner and entrusted her to the care of Zechariah. Every time Zechariah entered upon her in the sanctuary, he found with her provision. He said, « O Mary, from where is this for you? » She said, « It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without reckoning. » At that, Zechariah called upon his Lord, saying, « My Lord, grant me from Yourself a good offspring. Indeed, You are the Hearer of supplication. » So the angels called him while he was standing praying in the sanctuary, « Allah gives you good tidings of John (Yahya), confirming a word from Allah and a chief (Sayyid) and chaste (Hasour) and a Prophet from among the righteous. » He said, « My Lord, how can I have a boy when old age has reached me and my wife is barren? » He said, « Thus [it will be]; Allah does what He wills. »* The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) mentioned that Zechariah was a carpenter (*Najjâr*), narrated by Muslim on the authority of Abu Hurayrah. The Messenger of Allah also described John and Jesus as being maternal cousins (*Ibnā Khālah*), narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in the *Isrā'* (Night Journey) narrative: « Then he ascended until he reached the second heaven and asked for it to be opened. It was said, 'Who is this?' - 'Gabriel.' - 'And who is with you?' - 'Muhammad.' - 'Has a Message been sent for him?' - 'Yes.' - 'Welcome to him, and what an excellent coming he has come!' It was opened for us, and when I passed through, behold, there were John and Jesus, and they were maternal cousins. Gabriel said, 'These are John and Jesus, greet them.' I greeted them, and they returned the greeting, and then said, 'Welcome to the righteous brother and the righteous Prophet.' » As for the interpretation that John was incapable of sexual relations, derived from the term *« Hasoor »* [Surah Al Imran (3:39)], it is without proof and is not authentically established from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him). It is a flaw in manhood of which Allah purifies His Prophets. Moreover, the term *« Hasoor »* has many meanings: it refers to one who is incapable of approaching women, one who is narrow-chested, or one who protects himself from sins and impurities. This last meaning is the most appropriate for John. Until the next chapter, God willing, and may the peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.",

  "texte_original":"We speak to you about Hud, the first Arab prophet whose story Allah mentioned in the Qur’an. We have not found a reliable lineage for him in authentic reports, as historians differ on his genealogy. Some say he is Hud ibn Salih ibn Arfakhshad ibn Sam ibn Nuh, others say Hud is ‘Abir ibn Salih ibn Arfakhshad ibn Sam ibn Nuh, and others say he is Hud ibn Abdullah ibn Rabah ibn Al-Jarood or Jawar ibn ‘Ad ibn Aws ibn Iram ibn Sam ibn Nuh. None of these opinions can be relied upon because no authentic evidence supports them. Hud was sent to the people of ‘Ad after they had become a mighty nation. So how could he be directly linked to Sam ibn Nuh in the first and second accounts, or how could ‘Ad be his second-generation ancestor in the third account? Allah Almighty mentions that Hud was sent to ‘Ad, who lived in Al-Ahqaf, located in Yemen between Oman and Hadramout, overlooking the sea near Shukhr and extending to Al-Dahna. Their lands were among the most fertile and lush. Al-Ahqaf (plural of Haqf) refers to large sand dunes, either curved or rectangular. A chapter of the Qur’an is named Al-Ahqaf. The tribe of ‘Ad, to whom Hud was sent, were among the strongest and most formidable nations, with unmatched physiques. They are sometimes referred to as ‘Ad Iram, with the “first ‘Ad” referring to the earlier ‘Ad in history, as opposed to the second ‘Ad, which is Thamud, the people of Salih. The tribe of ‘Ad were pure Arabs. Many Qur’anic commentators note that they were the first nation after Noah’s people, based on the fact that Allah mentions Hud’s people after Noah’s in several chapters, such as Al-A’raf, Hud, and Ash-Shu’ara. However, mentioning Hud after Noah does not mean Hud came immediately after Noah, nor that his people were the first to commit shirk after the Flood. In Surah Al-Ahqaf, Allah says about Hud: \"And mention ‘Ad, when We sent against them a messenger from among themselves, Hud. He said, 'O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. Will you not fear Him?'\" [Al-Ahqaf: 21] And in Surah Fussilat: \"If they turn away, say, 'I have warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt that struck ‘Ad and Thamud when the messengers came to them before.'\" [Fussilat: 13–14] This clearly shows that Hud was one of the messengers sent by Allah. Not all messengers’ stories are mentioned in detail; Allah says: \"Some of them We relate to you, and some of them We do not relate to you.\" [Ghafir: 78] The Qur’an situates Hud’s story after Noah to remind his people of the flood and indicate that the people of ‘Ad were aware of Noah’s story. Hud’s mission included guiding his people away from shirk and reminding them of Allah’s commands. In Surah Al-A’raf, Allah says: \"And to ‘Ad [We sent] their brother Hud. He said: 'O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. Will you not fear Him?'\" [Al-A’raf: 65] In Surah Hud: \"And to ‘Ad [We sent] their brother Hud. He said: 'O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. You are only inventors [of falsehood].'\" [Hud: 50] And in Al-Ahqaf: \"And mention ‘Ad, when He warned their people in Al-Ahqaf, and the warners had passed away before him and after him, 'Do not worship anyone but Allah; indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous day.'\" [Al-Ahqaf: 21] Hud emphasized to his people that he did not ask for a reward for delivering the message, as is the case with all messengers. Allah says in Surah Hud: \"O my people, I do not ask you for any reward for it. My reward is only with the One who created me. Will you not understand?\" [Hud: 51] And in Surah Ash-Shu’ara: \"And I do not ask you for any reward for it. My reward is only with the Lord of the worlds.\" [Ash-Shu’ara: 180] Indeed, had they used their intellect, they would have believed, since Hud undertook this great mission without seeking any worldly reward. The messengers guided their people to what brings happiness in this world and the hereafter, reminding them to turn to Allah and avoid sins. In Surah Hud, Allah says: \"And ask forgiveness of your Lord, then repent to Him. He will send the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength to your strength. And do not turn away as criminals.\" [Hud: 52] Similar to the story of Noah: \"Say, 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever Forgiving. He will send rain upon you in abundance and provide you with wealth and children and make gardens for you.'\" [Noah: 10–12] Prophet Hud also showed that when the disbelievers could not counter his arguments, they would resort to saying he must be cursed by their gods. Allah says: \"They said, 'O Hud, you have not brought us clear proof, and we are not abandoning our gods because of what you say, nor do we believe you.'\" [Hud: 53] Hud replied: \"I bear witness to Allah, and you bear witness that I am free from what you associate with Him. So plan against me all together, then do not give me respite; indeed, I rely upon Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature whose fate He does not hold. Indeed, my Lord is on a straight path.\" [Hud: 54–57] This stance resembles that of Noah and Abraham, who relied on Allah alone. Allah protected Hud and those who believed with him from severe punishment, while the disbelievers were destroyed for rejecting their Lord. The Qur’an mentions: \"We saved Hud and those who believed with him by Our mercy and destroyed those who denied Our signs.\" [Hud: 50–60] The punishment for ‘Ad is described as a furious wind striking them for seven nights and eight days, leaving them lifeless like uprooted palm trees. The Qur’an says: \"And as for ‘Ad, We destroyed them with a furious wind, which left nothing they possessed intact.\" [Al-Dhariyat: 41–242] \"And We destroyed the first ‘Ad.\" [An-Najm: 50] \"‘Ad denied the messengers. How terrible was My punishment.\" [Al-Qamar \/ Al-Haqqah \/ Al-Fajr: 6] Narrations from Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) report that the Prophet (peace be upon him) never laughed loudly but smiled. When he saw clouds or wind, it would reflect on his face. Aisha asked about this, and he explained that the people often fear the punishment that Allah sends. Ibn Abbas reported that the Prophet said: \"‘Ad were destroyed by the wind",

We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You the All-Knowing, the Wise.’” [Al-Baqara: 30-33] Almighty God mentioned that He created him from soil, clay, pottery-like clay, and sticky clay. It is said in Surah Al-Imran: “The likeness of Jesus before God is like that of Adam: He created him from dust, then said ‘Be!’ and he was.” [Al-Imran: 59] And in Surah Al-A‘raf: “We certainly created you, then shaped you, then We said to the angels: ‘Prostrate to Adam!’ They prostrated except Iblis; he refused and was not among those who prostrated. He said: ‘Why did You not prostrate to what You created from clay?’” [Al-A‘raf: 11] And in Surah Al-Hijr: “We created man from baked clay, then We breathed into him of Our spirit…” [Al-Hijr: 26-33] And in Surah As-Sajda: “He Who perfected His creation…” [As-Sajda: 7] And in Surah At-Tin: “We created man from the best clay…” [At-Tin: 4] The description of the process indicates that God took a handful of all the soils of the Earth and shaped it. Thus, the children of Adam come from all the colors of the earth. This handful of soil was moistened by God, became clay, and depending on its transformation, was called pottery. Baked clay is called pottery. Sticky clay is clay that has hardened but retains a particular smell. Solid black clay is called “hamâ’ masnûn.” Adam’s height was sixty cubits. God created him with His hands, shaped him, and made him beautiful and healthy. According to a hadith reported by Abu Huraira, the Prophet ﷺ said: “God created Adam sixty cubits tall, then He said to him: go greet these angels and listen to their response; that will be your greeting and that of your descendants.” The angels replied: “Peace be upon you,” and added: “and the mercy of God.” All men entering Paradise will have Adam’s form, and humanity’s size gradually decreased over time until today. Regarding the tree Adam was forbidden to eat from, some say it was wheat, others fig, others vine, but the Prophet ﷺ did not specify which tree it was. The important point is that Adam and his wife were warned by God not to eat from this tree. According to Surah Al-Baqara: “O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat freely wherever you wish, but do not approach this tree, lest you be of the wrongdoers.” [Al-Baqara: 35] Satan deceived them, they ate from the tree, and God caused them to descend to Earth: “Descend, enemies one to another, and you will find on earth a dwelling and enjoyment for a time.” [Al-Baqara: 36] As for the number of Adam’s children, there is no exact information from the Qur’an or the Prophet ﷺ. Some say Eve had 40 children in 20 pregnancies, others 120, each pregnancy producing a son and a daughter. Ibn Kathir reports that Adam died after seeing 400,000 descendants. The story that Adam named a son Abd al-Harith is considered unauthentic and comes from the Isra’iliyat. It is not attributable to Adam and Eve; the real meaning of the story is to warn against associating partners with God (shirk). Regarding passing on his life to David, a weak hadith mentions that Adam gave 40 years of his life to David, bringing the latter’s life to 100 years. This hadith is not authentic and cannot be applied to Adam. For the murder of his son by Cain, there is no authentic narration about Adam’s hair or any poems attributed to him, and he did not build the Kaaba. Stories about his supplication to God in the name of Muhammad ﷺ are also weak and unauthentic. During the Isra and Mi‘raj, the Prophet ﷺ saw Adam in the first heaven and greeted him. Adam acknowledged the prophecy and the lineage of the children. Adam’s age at death and burial location are not specified in authentic sources. Regarding the discussion between Moses and Adam about destiny, the Prophet ﷺ reported that Adam won the argument: Moses blamed Adam for bringing humans down from Paradise, and Adam replied that what was written by God would happen anyway. Finally, concerning intercession on the Day of Judgment, Adam was not late; it is recalled that the argument of destiny only applies to disasters or involuntary mistakes, not to sins committed voluntarily.",

  "texte_original":"## Yusuf the Truthful: From Trial to Sovereignty In this chapter, we discuss the Noble son of the Noble, son of the Noble, son of the Noble, Yusuf (Joseph) the Truthful (*As-Siddîq*), the Prophet and Messenger of Allah. We have previously mentioned some aspects of his story when discussing his fathers, Ibrahim, Ishaq, and Ya'qub (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), peace be upon them. Genealogists generally agree that he was born to Ya'qub by his wife Rachel. Most scholars hold that she died when he was young, leaving him a younger full brother, Benjamin. Ya'qub had ten other sons from other wives, one of whom was Rachel's elder sister. Allah granted Yusuf such beauty and grace that he became proverbial for it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) described him as having been given 'half of all beauty.' Muslim narrated in his *Sahih*, in the story of the Night Journey and Ascension (Al-Isra wal-Mi'râj), from the Hadith of Anas ibn Malik, that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), in his account of his ascent to the highest heavens, said: \"Then we were ascended to the third heaven. Gabriel requested entry. It was asked: 'Who are you?' He said: 'Gabriel.' It was asked: 'Who is with you?' He said: 'Muhammad.' It was asked: 'Has he been sent for?' He said: 'He has been sent for.' It was opened for us, and I saw Yusuf; he had been given half of all beauty... \" (end of the Hadith). Allah the Blessed and Exalted mentioned concerning the women who criticized the wife of Al-Aziz (the Vizier) that when she tested them by arranging a banquet (or couches on which to recline) and giving each of them a knife, she told [Yusuf]: {Come out before them}. When they saw him, {they were greatly amazed (akbarnahû) and cut their hands, saying, 'Good Heavens! This is not a human being! This is none other than a noble angel!'} [Yusuf: 31]. His father Ya'qub loved him for the physical and inner beauty that Allah had bestowed upon him. His brothers noticed that their father loved Yusuf and Benjamin more than them, though their father knew their own character and conduct better than theirs. Since Yusuf's brothers were not infallible (*ma'sûmîn*) from sins and evil deeds (they were not Prophets, and though they were from the Tribes (*Al-Asbât*), they were not the specific *Asbât* whom Allah mentioned as receiving revelation, as in: {Indeed, We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah and the Prophets after him. And We revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes (Al-Asbât)...} [An-Nisa: 163]), they held malice towards Yusuf. The term *Sabt* (Tribe) applies to the son's son, no matter how far down the line, as well as to the daughter's son. Allah the Blessed and Exalted dedicated an entire Surah of the Qur'an to Yusuf, narrating his story. He concluded Sūrat Hūd with His saying: {And all that We relate to you of the news of the Messengers is to strengthen your heart therewith...} [Hūd: 120]. Having mentioned the news of the Messengers in Sūrat Hūd and the harm the Prophets suffered from relatives and strangers, He mentioned in Sūrat Yusuf, who is one of the great Messengers, the harm he suffered from his own brothers. This was to inform Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) and strengthen the hearts of the believers by showing them the suffering of the Prophets from both relatives and strangers. The story of Yusuf contains sublime laws, wisdom, manners, rules of conduct, lessons about the lives of kings, the thinking of scholars, the planning of strategies to achieve righteous goals, setting beautiful means to attain lofty objectives, the cunning of women, their lack of patience regarding temptations, the demonstration of the excellent outcome for the pious and patient, the father's compassion, and the fact that a person's diligence in guarding his child from evil does not save him from the Decree of Allah. It shows that a righteous father may have a disobedient son, and that forgiveness when having power is a noble trait. It also establishes the prophethood and message of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), the Seal of the Prophets, in addition to other indications and lessons that only Allah encompasses. Allah the Blessed and Exalted began Yusuf's story with the vision he saw when he was young, and concluded it with the fact that the honor and dignity he attained was the fulfillment of his vision. Concerning Yusuf's vision, Allah says: {When Joseph said to his father, 'O my father, indeed I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me'} [Yusuf: 4]. Ya'qub understood that this vision indicated that Yusuf was destined for something great: honor from Allah, exaltation of his status, and Allah's selection of him. He would complete His favor upon him and upon Ya'qub's family, just as He had completed it upon his two fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq. Ya'qub asked Yusuf to keep this vision secret from his brothers, sensing their malice and hatred for him, and knowing that revealing the story of the vision would only increase their rancor and cause them to plot against him. On this matter, Allah says: {He said, 'O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers, lest they plot against you a plot. Indeed, Satan is to man a clear enemy. And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narratives and complete His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob, as He completed it upon your fathers before, Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is Knowing and Wise'} [Yusuf: 5-6]. Ya'qub also understood from this vision that his son Yusuf would be highly skilled in the interpretation of dreams, which implies a raised status, high rank, and authority on earth. The majority of exegetes agree that the eleven stars are Yusuf's brothers, and the sun and the moon are his father and his aunt, or his father and his mother. Allah described the affair of Yusuf and his brothers as Signs for those who ask, saying: {There were certainly in [the story of] Joseph and his brothers signs for those who ask} [Yusuf: 7]. Meaning, lessons, admonitions, wonders, and wisdom for those who seek knowledge, contemplate, and heed. They show the effect of envy on its possessor, the ultimate fate of the envious, the effects of patience, the praiseworthy outcome for the patient, a father's compassion, that a person's diligence in preserving his son from evil does not save him from the Decree of Allah, and that a righteous father may beget a disobedient son. They also show that forgiveness when having power is the character of the noble, and affirm the prophethood and message of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), the Seal of the Prophets, as well as other indications and lessons that only Allah encompasses. The first sign of evil intent from Yusuf's brothers was their saying: {Joseph and his brother [Benjamin] are more beloved to our father than we} [Yusuf: 8]. His inclination toward them was greater, his tenderness towards them was more profound, and his affection for them was stronger. {While we are a cohesive group ('uṣbah)}, a strong, united company, which is more beneficial to our father. {Indeed, our father is in clear error [concerning this love]}, far from guidance and correctness. Some of them said to each other: We must turn Yusuf away from our father's attention. Some proposed killing him, others proposed throwing him in a distant land where wild beasts would devour him or where he would die, and then they would become righteous people. Others suggested getting him away from their father while trying to save him from immediate death by throwing him {into the bottom of the well} [Yusuf: 10] - the dark part of the well, similar to a modern well-pump chamber, so that a traveler might pick him up. They finally agreed to put him in a dark place in a well frequented by travelers going from Palestine to Egypt. When they started to execute the plan, they said to their father: {O our father, why do you not entrust us with Joseph while we are indeed to him sincere counselors? Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play, and indeed, we will be his guardians} [Yusuf: 11-12]. Ya'qub replied that he could not bear his absence, that his departure would grieve him, and that he feared the wolf might devour him while they were heedless and playing. They dismissed the fear of the wolf, arguing that they were an 'uṣbah (a strong group that supports one another). If a wolf were to reach him despite their strength and number, they would be worthless, ruined, incapable, and weak. They took him from his father, despite his caution, for caution does not avert the Divine Decree. They left Benjamin behind. They went to the well and threw him {into the bottom of the well} (*ghayabat al-jubb*). If they had thrown him into the middle of the well, he would have died. Allah cast tranquility into his heart, assuring him that he would not perish in this well, that he would see his envious brothers again, and that he would inform them of what they did to him at a time when he would be honored and they humbled. They had stripped him of his shirt before throwing him in the well and put false blood upon it (a fabricated lie, not Yusuf's blood). {And they came to their father at night, weeping} [Yusuf: 16]. They said to him: {O our father, indeed we went off racing and left Joseph with our belongings, and the wolf ate him. But you would not believe us, even if we were truthful} [Yusuf: 17]. Ya'qub did not believe them about the wolf or his death, for he was certain that Yusuf had a great destiny. Therefore, he said to them: {Rather, your souls have enticed you to [do] something. So patience is most fitting (ṣabrun jamîl). And Allah is the one sought for help against that which you describe} [Yusuf: 18]. To the next chapter, if Allah wills. Peace and Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you. --- ## Chapter Thirty-One: Continuation of Yusuf the Truthful In the previous chapter, I mentioned the actions of Yusuf's brothers, their plot against him, their trickery in taking him from their father, and throwing him into the well. Concerning this, Allah says: {There were certainly in [the story of] Joseph and his brothers signs for those who ask. When they said, 'Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we, while we are a cohesive group. Indeed, our father is in clear error. Kill Joseph or cast him out to [some] land; the attention of your father will [then] be only for you, and thereafter you will be righteous people.' Said a speaker among them, 'Do not kill Joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well; some travelers will pick him up - that is, some passing travelers from the caravans - if you would do [something]'} [Yusuf: 7-10]. {They said, 'O our father, why do you not entrust us with Joseph while we are indeed to him sincere counselors? Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play, and indeed, we will be his guardians.' He said, 'Indeed, it grieves me that you should take him, and I fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware.' They said, 'If a wolf should eat him while we are a cohesive group, then [indeed] we would be losers.' So when they took him away and agreed to put him into the bottom of the well, We inspired to him, 'You will surely inform them of this affair of theirs while they do not perceive [who you are].' And they came to their father at night, weeping. They said, 'O our father, indeed we went off racing and left Joseph with our belongings, and the wolf ate him. But you would not believe us, even if we were truthful.' And they presented upon his shirt false blood. [Jacob] said, 'Rather, your souls have enticed you to [do] something. So patience is most fitting! And Allah is the one sought for help against that which you describe'} [Yusuf: 11-18]. Ya'qub's stance when his sons told him that the wolf had eaten their brother Yusuf, despite his certainty that his sons were lying and that Yusuf was facing a severe trial, was this noble stance of patience in the face of calamity, delegation of the matter to Allah, and lack of despair. This is an example for every righteous servant who is tried and tested. Thus, Al-Bukhari reported that 'Aishah, the Truthful daughter of the Truthful, the Mother of the Believers, the chaste and dignified, when she was accused of the slander (Al-Ifk), said: \"By Allah, I find no example for you and me except the father of Yusuf when he said: {So patience is most fitting! And Allah is the one sought for help against that which you describe} [Yusuf: 18]. \" Allah the Blessed and Exalted described what happened to Yusuf after his brothers cast him into the well, indicating that his time alone in the well was not long. Allah prepared for him a group of travelers who stopped near the well. They sent their water drawer (Wârid), a person who comes to the well to draw water for them. He let down his bucket into the well, and Yusuf clung to it. When the drawer sensed him, he pulled him out, exclaiming: \"Oh, good news! This is a boy! \" (Yâ buchrâ hâdhâ ghulâm). He secretly agreed with some of his companions to claim that he was a slave whom they had obtained to sell to wealthy people near the well in Egypt. It was as if Yusuf felt he could not refute their claim of his slavery, so he submitted. It was as if those who made him a commodity realized that they were facing a noble human being, one who should not be passed around among common people. They decided that it was only fitting to present him to the Vizier (Aziz), the chief minister of the King of Egypt, as an honor to him. As soon as they reached Egypt, they presented him to its Vizier and sold him for a nominal price: {for a meager price - a few counted dirhams} (a small number) [Yusuf: 20]. They were certain that this noble person was worthy of being settled in the Vizier's house in any case, and that they were not worthy of keeping him under their hands or the hands of anyone less than the Vizier. The stages of honoring, esteem, veneration, and exaltation began to unfold for Yusuf. The Vizier's joy in him was immense. He said to his wife: {Make his stay comfortable}, and lodge him in the best quarters: {Perhaps he will benefit us, or we will adopt him as a son} [Yusuf: 21]. Thus, a misfortune can sometimes be a blessing: he moved from the hardships of desert life to the greatest civilized palaces. His being thrown into the well became the reason for his arrival in Egypt and his progression through stages of dignity until he became its ruler. Allah showed mercy to the servants and the land through him, especially during the years of drought and famine, so much so that the blessings Allah conferred through him extended to his father and brothers. This served to strengthen the heart of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), informing him: 'I am aware of the harm your people inflict upon you, but the relief is near. I will grant you a good outcome and mastery over them.' And Allah did so: it was not long before the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) emigrated to Medina. A few years after Yusuf's separation from his father, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) conquered Mecca, and people entered the religion of Allah in crowds. It is reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) asked the people of Mecca who had harmed and expelled him: \"What do you think I will do to you? \" They replied: \"You are noble, the son of a noble brother. \" He said: {I will not say to you except what my brother Joseph said: 'No blame will there be upon you this day. May Allah forgive you; and He is the most merciful of the merciful'} [Yusuf: 92]. \"Go, for you are free. \" Allah the Blessed and Exalted described Yusuf's transfer to the house of the Vizier of Egypt as an establishment (Tamkîn) for him in the land. He reached his full strength (*ashuddah*), and Allah gave him wisdom (*ḥukm*) and knowledge (*'ilm*). In all this, Allah says: {And there came a caravan, and they sent their water drawer, and he let down his bucket. He said, 'Oh, good news! This is a boy.' And they concealed him [intending] as merchandise; and Allah was knowing of what they did. And they sold him - meaning: they sold him - for a meager price, a few counted dirhams, and they were among those who were indifferent concerning him - their indifference was one of reverence and respect, not disdain or contempt. And the one who bought him from Egypt said to his wife, 'Make his stay comfortable; perhaps he will benefit us, or we will adopt him as a son.' And thus, We established (makannâ) Joseph in the land, and that We might teach him the interpretation of narratives. And Allah is predominant over His affair, but most of the people do not know. And when he reached his full maturity, We gave him judgment and knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good} [Yusuf: 19-22]. Allah the Blessed and Exalted mentioned that the wife of the Vizier's heart became attached to Yusuf. {She was overcome by passion for him (qad shaghafahâ ḥubban)}, meaning his love penetrated the *shighâf* (cover or veil) of her heart, or its *suwaydâ* (innermost part). She felt as if he were a king and she his slave, offering everything she could to make him happy, honored, and respected. It reached a point where she contemplated intercourse with him. She used every kind of enticement before him, but he turned away, heedless of her actions. When she realized that her attempts at seduction did not turn his attention to her, she concluded, as it is said: * \"Objectives are not attained by wishes, but the world is taken by might. \"* Hinting had not benefited her, and she had to state her need clearly to Yusuf. {She closed the doors and said, 'Come to me (Hayta laka),' meaning: I have prepared and beautified myself for you, so come. {He said, 'I seek refuge in Allah!'} (Ma'âdha Allâh), meaning: I seek protection and shelter in Allah from committing the crime of Zina, which is the most heinous of crimes. Allah has been so kind to me, providing me with a good home and noble standing. How can I repay His goodness with disobedience? The wrongdoers do not succeed: {Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed}. The fornicators will not succeed, for Zina leads to the loss of blessings in this world and Allah's punishment in the Hereafter. Since the woman's impulsiveness and sexual fervor had reached its peak, she paid no heed to his refusal and chastity and rushed towards him. Had Allah not protected His Prophets and Messengers from evil, he might have succumbed. But the favors of Allah became manifest to Yusuf, and Allah turned away from him the evil and the immorality. He ran toward the door to escape her. She chased him and caught his shirt from behind, pulling it so that the shirt was torn {from the back (min dubur)}. He managed to reach the door, and the Vizier was there. She quickly moved to pin the blame on Yusuf and said to her husband: {What is the recompense for one who intended ill for your wife but that he should be imprisoned or undergo a painful punishment?} Yusuf defended himself and said to the Vizier: {It was she who sought to seduce me}. Allah caused a witness from her family to speak. He said to the Vizier: {If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars}, because she would have torn it while defending herself as he approached her. {But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful}, because she would have torn it as he tried to flee and she pursued him. When the Vizier saw that the shirt was torn from the back, he was convinced of Yusuf's innocence. It is noteworthy here that the witness began by considering the shirt being torn from the front, to make his attempt to prove her innocence more plausible, lest he be accused of favoring Yusuf, even though he was from her family. This would make his testimony more acceptable to them both. This is similar to what the believer from the people of Pharaoh said to Pharaoh and his people concerning Moses: {And if he is a liar, upon him will be [the consequence of] his lie; but if he should be truthful, there will strike you some of what he promises you. Indeed, Allah does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar} [Ghafir: 28]. This believer began the hypothetical scenario with the possibility that he might be a liar, and followed it with the possibility that he might be truthful, to make his words more impactful on their hearts and closer to their acceptance of his advice. Allah the Blessed and Exalted did not name the Vizier's wife, nor did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him). People call her Zulaikhâ' or Râ'îl. Since there was no great benefit in identifying her name, Allah did not name her for us. He only mentioned the important matter that points to Yusuf's high stature and purity: that he was in her house, that she closed the doors, that she said {Come to me}, and that she desired him (*hammat bih*). Yet, despite that, Allah turned away from him the evil and the immorality. Concerning all this, Allah says: {And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him. She closed the doors and said, 'Come to me.' He said, 'I seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, he is my master, who has made my residence comfortable. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.' And she certainly desired him, and he would have desired her had he not seen the proof of his Lord. Thus [it was] that We should avert from him evil and immorality. Indeed, he was one of Our selected servants. And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back. And they found her master at the door. She said, 'What is the recompense for one who intended ill for your wife but that he should be imprisoned or undergo a painful punishment?' [Joseph] said, 'It was she who sought to seduce me.' And a witness from her family testified, 'If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars. But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful.' So when [the master] saw his shirt torn from the back, he said, 'Indeed, it is of the cunning of you women. Indeed, your cunning is great. Joseph, disregard this. And [you, woman], ask forgiveness for your sin. Indeed, you were of the sinful'} [Yusuf: 23-29]. To the next chapter, if Allah wills. Peace and Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you. --- ## Chapter Thirty-Two: Continuation of Yusuf the Truthful I mentioned at the end of the previous chapter what Allah disclosed regarding the Vizier's attempt to keep his wife's attempted seduction of Yusuf a secret, and how he asked her to seek Allah's forgiveness for her sin and that she was among the sinful, saying: {Joseph, disregard this. And [you, woman], ask forgiveness for your sin. Indeed, you were of the sinful} [Yusuf: 29]. However, the concealment of this incident did not succeed. It was circulated by tongues, and the women in the city (wives of princes and daughters of notables) spoke of it. They criticized and deplored the action of the Vizier's wife, severely condemning her for trying to seduce her young servant and for her intense love for him. They became eager to see him. When she heard their criticism, denigration, and blame for her love of her servant, realizing that they did not know that Yusuf's beauty could enchant those of sound mind, she wanted to present her excuse to them and show that a young man like him was unparalleled. She sent for them, gathered them at her house, prepared a feast, and included something to be cut with knives, like the citron (*utrujj*) or similar, and gave a knife to each one of them. When they began cutting what they held with the knives, she ordered Yusuf to come out before them. He emerged, undoubtedly more handsome than the full moon. When they saw him, they were greatly amazed (*akbarnahû*), revered him, were awestruck, and astonished at his sight. His beauty so overwhelmed them that they forgot themselves, and began cutting and carving their hands with the knives instead of cutting the fruit, without even feeling the wounds. They thought that one like him did not exist among the sons of Adam, and {they said, 'Good Heavens! This is not a human being! This is none other than a noble angel!'} [Yusuf: 31]. Meaning: May Allah forbid that this be from the sons of Adam. This is none other than a noble angel. The people of Egypt at that time, although idolaters, acknowledged the Lord of the heavens and the earth, like the polytheists of Quraysh and others, even if they worshipped others besides Allah. It was then that the Vizier's wife revealed the concealed passion and infatuation in her heart. {She said, 'That is the one about whom you blamed me!'} [Yusuf: 32]. She highlighted his chastity and complete innocence, saying: {And I did certainly seek to seduce him, but he firmly refused (fasta'ṣama). And if he does not do what I order him, he will surely be imprisoned and will be among the humiliated (aṣ-ṣâghirîn)} [Yusuf: 32]. There is no doubt that her infatuation and madness for him had reached the extent that she publicly declared this to the gathering of people. When Yusuf heard her threat of imprisonment and humiliation if he did not submit to her will, {He said, 'My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me. And if You do not avert from me their plan, I might incline toward them and be among the ignorant'} [Yusuf: 33]. Meaning: No one but You can turn away evil from me, O Most Merciful of the merciful. Do not entrust me to myself even for the blink of an eye, for if You entrust me to myself, You entrust me to weakness and incapability, and I possess no power to benefit or harm myself except what Allah wills. Protect me from evil, guard me from wickedness, and shield me with Your might and power, O Lord of the Worlds. {So his Lord responded to him and averted from him their plan. Indeed, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing} [Yusuf: 34]. By this, Yusuf deserved to be at the head of the seven people whom Allah will shade with His Shade on the Day when there is no shade but His. One of them is 'a man who was invited by a woman of rank and beauty, but he said: Indeed, I fear Allah,' as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) informed in the Hadith found in the two *Sahihs*. After Yusuf's innocence became widespread, the Vizier and his wife concluded that it was in their interest to imprison Yusuf to minimize public talk about the issue. They wanted to make it seem that he was the one who sought to seduce her and was imprisoned because of it. Thus, they imprisoned him unjustly and aggressively. However, prison was dearer to Yusuf than being among them, and it distanced him from their company and proximity. Concerning this, Allah says: {And [some] women in the city said, 'The wife of Al-Aziz is seeking to seduce her slave boy; he has definitely overcome her with love. Indeed, we see her in clear error.' So when she heard of their scheming, she sent to them and prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said [to Joseph], 'Come out before them.' And when they saw him, they were greatly amazed and cut their hands and said, 'Good Heavens! This is not a human being! This is none other than a noble angel!' She said, 'That is the one about whom you blamed me. And I certainly sought to seduce him, but he firmly refused. And if he does not do what I order him, he will surely be imprisoned and will be among the humiliated.' He said, 'My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me. And if You do not avert from me their plan, I might incline toward them and be among the ignorant.' So his Lord responded to him and averted from him their plan. Indeed, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. Then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs that they should surely imprison him for a time} [Yusuf: 30-35]. Allah the Blessed and Exalted ordained that two young men should enter the prison with Yusuf the Truthful. When they saw Yusuf in prison, they were impressed by his demeanor, his guidance, and the majesty and splendor that Allah had bestowed upon him. They observed his nobility, honor, abundant worship of Allah, and benevolence towards Allah's creation. His conduct was the most eloquent call to Allah, and their hearts became attached to him. Each of them had a dream, and they realized that the best interpreter was Yusuf the Truthful. They approached him, and each recounted his dream. One said: \"Indeed, I saw myself pressing wine. \" The other said: \"Indeed, I saw myself carrying upon my head [some] bread, from which the birds were eating. \" They said to him: \"Inform us of its interpretation. Indeed, we see you to be of the doers of good. \" Before interpreting their dreams, he took the opportunity of their sincere approach to invite them to Allah. However, before calling them directly to the unity of Allah, he began by introducing himself and the grace of Allah upon him and his fathers. He told them that he was knowledgeable in the interpretation of visions and dreams. \"No meal of [daily] provision comes to you but that I inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you. That is from what my Lord has taught me. \" He clarified that this knowledge was not from him, but from Allah who taught him. Before proceeding to the sheer call to the oneness of Allah, he used the most beautiful method of inviting to Allah by rejecting the worship of idols and statues, and stressing that no one should attach themselves to them. He said: {Indeed, I have left the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah, and they are, in regard to the Hereafter, disbelievers. And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. And it was not for us to associate anything with Allah. That is from the favor of Allah upon us and upon mankind, but most of the people are not grateful} [Yusuf: 37-38]. The greatest gift a servant can be given is the rejection of idol worship and the recognition of Allah's right. Having reached this point, he proceeded to call them directly to the oneness of Allah, saying: {O my two companions of prison, are separate lords better or Allah, the One, the Irresistible? You worship not besides Him except [mere] names you have named them, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority} [Yusuf: 39-40]. He explained that all creation belongs to Allah, and all authority belongs to Allah, and that no one is permitted to seek judgment from other than Allah's Law, for to Allah belongs the creation and the command: {The judgment is only for Allah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know} [Yusuf: 40]. After inviting them to Allah, he interpreted each of their dreams. The one who saw himself pressing wine would exit the prison and serve wine to his master. As for the other, who saw himself carrying bread on his head from which the birds were eating, he would be crucified, and the birds would eat from his head. He did not specify which one would be crucified, but only said: One of you will serve his master wine, and the other will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head. The matter concerning which they asked for interpretation was settled (*quḍiya al-amr*). The implication of the interpretation was: let the one decreed to be crucified be patient, and let the one who will be saved be thankful. {And he said to the one whom he knew would be saved among them, 'Mention me to your master' (dh-kurnî 'inda rabbika)} [Yusuf: 42], and mention that I am being wronged. (*Adh-Dhan* - thought - can mean certainty, as in Allah's saying: {I thought that I would meet my account} [Al-Hâqqa: 20], and {those who think that they will meet their Lord} [Al-Baqarah: 46], and {Do those not think that they will be resurrected for a tremendous Day?} [Al-Muṭaffifîn: 4-5]). Satan made the saved man forget to mention the wronged prisoner Yusuf to the king. So, Yusuf remained in prison for 'a few years' (*biḍ'a sinîn*), a number of years. *Al-Biḍ'* is said to be between three and nine years, or three to five, or four to nine, or seven. Allah the Blessed and Exalted narrated this in His Noble Book, saying: {And two young men entered the prison with him. One of them said, 'Indeed, I saw myself [in a dream] pressing wine.' And the other said, 'Indeed, I saw myself carrying upon my head [some] bread, from which the birds were eating. Inform us of its interpretation; indeed, we see you to be of the doers of good.' He said, 'No food will come to you as provision but that I will inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you. That is from what my Lord has taught me. Indeed, I have left the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah, and they are, in regard to the Hereafter, disbelievers. And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. And it was not for us to associate anything with Allah. That is from the favor of Allah upon us and upon mankind, but most of the people are not grateful. O my two companions of prison, are separate lords better or Allah, the One, the Irresistible? You worship not besides Him except [mere] names you have named them, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. The judgment is only for Allah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know. O my two companions of prison, as for one of you, he will give his master wine to drink; but as for the other, he will be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. The matter about which you have asked has been decreed.' And he said to the one whom he knew would be saved among them, 'Mention me to your master.' But Satan made him forget the mention [to] his master, and [consequently] Joseph remained in prison for a few years} [Yusuf: 36-42]. Yusuf's statement: {Mention me to your master} [Yusuf: 42] indicates that taking means (or causes) does not contradict reliance upon Allah (Tawakkul). Some people have claimed that the pronoun in {But Satan made him forget the mention [to] his master} [Yusuf: 42] refers to Yusuf, and that he was punished by the prolonged stay in prison for seeking relief from other than Allah. This is a lie against Allah and against Yusuf. As for what Ibn Jarîr mentioned in his *Tafsîr*, citing a narration attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) through Ibn 'Abbâs: \"Had he - meaning Yusuf - not said the word he said, he would not have remained long in prison, as he sought relief from other than Allah, \" this narration is not authentic from the Messenger of Allah. Ibn Kathîr said in his *Tafsîr*: \"This Hadith is very weak... \" To the next chapter, if Allah wills. Peace and Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you. --- ## Chapter Thirty-Three: Continuation of Yusuf the Truthful In the previous chapter, I pointed out the forgetfulness of the saved prison companion of Yusuf to mention Yusuf's situation to the king. Allah the Blessed and Exalted attributed this forgetting to Satan, saying: {But Satan made him forget the mention [to] his master} [Yusuf: 42]. This style, of attributing evil to Satan, has been repeated by Allah the Blessed and Exalted in the Noble Qur'an, such as in the story of Ayyub (Job): {When he called to his Lord, 'Indeed, Satan has touched me with hardship and torment'} [Sad: 41]. This is because every evil and harm that befalls a person is due to Satan, who caused our parents to be expelled from Paradise. This is a matter of etiquette (*adab*) towards Allah: attributing good to Him and evil to Satan and the soul that commands evil (*an-nafs al-ammârah bis-sû'*), while firmly believing that everything is by the Decree and Will of Allah, and that everything comes from Allah: {And that Allah may purify those who believe [through trials] and destroy the disbelievers} [Âl 'Imrân: 141]. When Allah the Blessed and Exalted willed to exalt Yusuf's rank and confirm his dignity in the hearts of the King of Egypt and his entire people, the King saw in his sleep seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean ones, as well as seven green ears of grain and seven others dry. The King was greatly concerned by his dream and asked the nobles of his people, and those whom he thought possessed knowledge of interpretation, to interpret and explain it to him, and to advise him on what the dream required. They said: {These are mixtures of false dreams (aḍghâth aḥlâm), and we are not learned in the interpretation of [such] dreams} [Yusuf: 44]. *Aḍ-Dighth* (mixture) is a handful of mixed grass, both dry and wet. Meaning: this is a confusing dream whose interpretation is invalid, and we are not capable of interpreting it. It was then that the saved prison companion remembered Yusuf after this long period and said: {I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me [to him]! [He said]: Joseph, O man of truth, explain to us about seven fat cows eaten by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of grain and [seven] others dry, that I may return to the people, perhaps they may know [the meaning]} [Yusuf: 45-46]. So they sent him to Yusuf. As soon as the dream was presented to him, he quickly interpreted it. He explained the seven fat cows and the seven green ears of grain as seven years of plentiful bounty and rich harvest. He interpreted the seven lean and scrawny cows and the seven dry ears of grain as seven years of famine and drought. He did not stop at this profound interpretation of the King's dream but provided them with a plan to overcome the hardship of the seven years of famine. He said: {You shall sow for seven years consecutively. And what you harvest, leave in its heads, except a little of which you will eat. Then will come after that seven hard [years] which will consume what you saved for them, except a little of that which you will store. Then will come after that a year in which the people will have relief (yughâth) and in which they will press [olives, etc.]} [Yusuf: 47-49]. Meaning: you should sow during the seven years, utilizing the opportunity of plenty and good harvest without wasting anything. When the grain is ripe, do not thresh it, but leave it in its ears, except for your necessary food consumption. Do not be extravagant in spending, and store everything you can during these fertile years so that you will have what you need during the seven years of famine. He gave them the glad tidings that Allah would send them rain (*yughâth*) in the first year after the seven lean years, the drought would end, and the oil presses and similar operations would resume their work as before these years. Undoubtedly, the advice of Yusuf the Truthful to preserve the grain in its ears is still admired and appreciated by agricultural scientists, ancient and modern, for keeping grain in its ears better protects it from weevils and decay and preserves it for a long time without the need for modern silos or the like. When the King heard this interpretation, Yusuf grew in his heart, and it became clear to him that he was in dire need of his presence. He said: {Bring him to me! (I'tûnî bih!)} [Yusuf: 50]. When the messenger came to him and informed him that the King was summoning him to honor and exalt him, he did not rush out of prison. Instead, he asked the messenger to return to the King and ask him about the affair of the women who had cut their hands. This was to make his innocence more apparent and his position more dignified, and to put an end to bad rumors. Allah is aware of all things. The majority of scholars hold that the meaning of the Messenger of Allah's (peace and blessings be upon him) saying in the authentic Hadith: \"Had I remained in prison as long as Yusuf, I would have answered the caller \" means: I would have rushed out of prison without hesitation, and would have responded to the King's messenger immediately. In any case, the purpose of this Hadith, as I mentioned in the story of Ibrahim and Lot, is to show Yusuf's high rank, not to suggest that he is superior to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him). It is unanimously agreed upon by the sensible that the humility of a high-ranking person toward those below him does not diminish his status. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) is the best of all of Allah's creation, the chief of the Messengers, and the Imam of the Prophets. He is the one with the highest degrees (*Darajât*), referred to in Allah's saying: {Those messengers - We preferred some of them over others. Among them were those to whom Allah spoke, and He raised some of them many degrees} [Al-Baqarah: 253]. The Messenger of Allah, Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), is among the Messengers a heaven that no other heaven has surpassed. The King asked the women who had cut their hands: {What was your situation when you sought to seduce Joseph?} [Yusuf: 51]. They said: {Good Heavens! We know of no evil committed by him}. The Vizier's wife said: {Now the truth has become manifest (ḥaṣḥaṣa al-ḥaqq)! It was I who sought to seduce him, and indeed, he is of the truthful} [Yusuf: 51]. {That is so he may know that I did not betray him in [his] absence} (I acknowledge his virtue even in his absence), {and that Allah does not guide the plot of betrayers}. And the Vizier's wife also said: {And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent evil-doer, except those upon which my Lord has mercy. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful} [Yusuf: 53]. When the King was certain that Yusuf had been unjustly imprisoned, and that he was a man of noble trustworthiness and great knowledge, the King could not bear to wait. He said: {Bring him to me, I will select him for myself!} [Yusuf: 54]. When Yusuf came and spoke with him, the King said to him: {Indeed, you are today, with us, established [in position] and trusted} [Yusuf: 54]. Yusuf, desiring to benefit the land and the servants, said to the King: {He said, 'Appoint me over the storehouses of the land (khazâ'in al-arḍ). Indeed, I am a knowledgeable guardian'} [Yusuf: 55]. So Allah established (makkana) Yusuf in the land of Egypt, allowing him to settle wherever he willed, free, noble, a master, and obeyed, by the favor of Allah upon him and upon all doers of good. This is in this world, {But the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believed and were constantly conscious of Allah} [Yusuf: 57]. Concerning this, Allah says: {And [subsequently] the king said, 'Indeed, I have seen [in a dream] seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean ones and seven green ears of grain and [seven] others dry. O council, advise me concerning my vision, if you should interpret visions.' They said, 'It is a mixture of false dreams, and we are not learned in the interpretation of [such] dreams.' But the one of the two [prisoners] who was saved and remembered after a period of time said, 'I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me [to him].' [He said], 'Joseph, O man of truth, explain to us about seven fat cows eaten by seven lean ones and seven green ears of grain and [seven] others dry, that I may return to the people, perhaps they may know [the meaning].' He said, 'You shall sow for seven years consecutively. And what you harvest, leave in its heads, except a little of which you will eat. Then will come after that seven hard [years] which will consume what you saved for them, except a little of that which you will store. Then will come after that a year in which the people will have relief and in which they will press [olives, etc.].' And [subsequently] the king said, 'Bring him to me!'} [Yusuf: 43-50]. ## The Stories of the Prophets: The True Narration When the messenger came to him (Joseph), he said: “Go back to your master and ask him what was the case of the women who cut their hands? Indeed, my Lord is Knowing of their plot.” Meaning that my God, my Creator, my Master, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, is fully aware of the cunning and plotting of women which led me to the prison. (The King) said: “What was your business when you solicited Joseph for his person?” They said: “God forbid! We know no evil against him.” The wife of Al-Aziz said: “Now the truth has come to light. It was I who sought to seduce him, and he is indeed one of the truthful.” (Joseph said): “This is so that he may know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that God does not guide the plot of betrayers.” “And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent inciter of evil, except that upon which my Lord has mercy. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.” The King said: “Bring him to me; I will reserve him for myself.” And when he had spoken to him, he said: “Indeed, you are today, with us, established in position and trusted.” (Joseph) said: “Appoint me over the treasuries of the land. Indeed, I am a knowing guardian.” And thus, We established Joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed. We bestow Our mercy upon whom We will, and We do not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good. And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believed and used to fear God. [Yusuf: 43-57] Some commentators have reported here false traditions and rejected, baseless reports in the exegesis of some of these verses. Allah the Most High protects His Prophets and Messengers from what is narrated in these exegeses, such as what was narrated concerning His saying “and she certainly desired him, and he would have desired her,” [Yusuf: 24] that he untied his waist-tie, meaning the drawstring of his trousers, and sat with her in the manner of a man with his wife. This, praise be to God, is not established by any report from the Messenger of Allah. Rather, it is an interpolated statement from the Jews and the narrations of the Children of Israel. The explicit wording of the verse connects his desire to seeing the evidence of his Lord in the past tense, as if to say: Had he not seen the proof of his Lord, he would have desired her, but he did not desire her because he saw the proof of his Lord. The context of the verse contradicts their claims, such as the Almighty's saying about her: “And she certainly sought to seduce him from himself, but he sought refuge.” [Yusuf: 32], connected by the letter 'fa' which denotes immediate succession, meaning that as soon as she sought to seduce him, he sought refuge. This is apparent. Likewise, their interpretation of His saying: “Indeed, he has made my residence excellent,” [Yusuf: 23] as meaning that he referred to the governor (Al-Aziz) of Egypt. This, praise be to God, is not established by any authentic or even *Hasan* report from the Messenger of Allah. The context indicates that the one whose proof Joseph saw and who made his residence excellent is the Lord of the Worlds. They also claimed that His saying: “This is so that he may know that I did not betray him in his absence,” [Yusuf: 52] was a statement of Joseph to Al-Aziz's wife, and that Gabriel said to him: “Nor when you desired her,” or that Al-Aziz's wife said to him at that time: “Nor when you untied your trousers, O Joseph.” All of this is a fabrication against Joseph the Truthful. Allah protected and preserved him from every evil, just as He protected his brothers, the Prophets and Messengers. “Exalted is your Lord, the Lord of Might, above what they describe. And peace upon the Messengers. And praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds.” [As-Saffat: 180-182] To the next chapter, God willing, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. * ## The Stories of the Prophets: The True Narration ### Continuation of (the story of) Joseph the Truthful After Allah had established Joseph and the King had decided to make him his *Aziz* (Minister\/Governor), granting him freedom to manage the treasuries of the land, people near and far needed to obtain provisions from him. The regions adjacent to Egypt, especially the land of Canaan, were then in dire need of food. So they came to Joseph to procure provisions for themselves, their families, and their people. They brought with them to Egypt whatever goods and money they had. Joseph had decided that he would not give any of them more than a specific measure of grain in one turn, and they could return at a later time in the future to take another share, according to the method known in the modern era and in some parts of the world as the rationing system. And the brothers of Joseph came to procure provisions when they learned that the *Aziz* of Egypt was giving people food for its price. They took with them goods to exchange for food. Jacob had kept his son Benjamin with him. When they reached Joseph and entered upon him, he recognized them because they were grown men when they threw him into the pit, so their appearances had not changed. As for Joseph, he was young when he was thrown into the pit, and a young person, when he grows up and reaches his full strength, is hardly recognized by someone who only saw him in childhood, because his features generally change. Therefore, his brothers did not recognize him, and it did not occur to them that he was Joseph the Truthful. It appeared that Joseph began to ask them about their situation and their families to find assurance regarding the state of his father and his brother Benjamin. They informed him of their situation and that they had a brother from their father, and that their father was Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham. Joseph honored them and showed them concern, ordered their provisions to be prepared, and gave them their full measure. It was then as if he said to them: You have made me long for your brother from your father, and I am eager to see him. You will not obtain any measure from me in the future turns unless you bring me your brother from your father. And as a token of my increased honor for you then, I will add to your measure the load of a camel and double your provisions. He instructed his servants to secretly place all the merchandise they had brought into their saddlebags, as a gesture of kindness and to maintain their family ties, and to keep their wealth with them so they might return to Joseph out of need. He did not openly put their merchandise in their bags because that might have led them to refuse to take it. The brothers said to Joseph: “We will strive with all our effort to bring our brother from our father with us next time, and we will try to persuade his father with all our power, and we will not fail in that.” When they returned to their father, they told him their story with the *Aziz* of Egypt, and that he had decided not to give them any measure in the future unless they brought their brother Benjamin with them. They pleaded with him to send him with them so they could obtain provisions, and they promised to guard him most strictly. Jacob said: “How can I trust you with him except as I trusted you with his brother Joseph before? You claimed you would guard him when you said about Joseph: 'Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and indeed, we will be his guardians' [Yusuf: 12]. But Allah Most High is the Guardian for him, and He is the Best of Guardians, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.” And when they opened their baggage, they found their merchandise returned to them. They said: “O our father! What more could we desire? Here are our goods returned to us. Send our brother with us next time so we may get food for our family, and we will guard our brother, and we will gain the measure of a camel load.” That generous gift was easy for this noble *Aziz*. Jacob then decided to send Benjamin with them on the condition that they give him an oath and a solemn covenant by Allah that they would guard him and not fail in his protection unless they were overwhelmed by something they could not repel or overcome. When they swore to him and confirmed their covenant, Jacob made Allah Most High a witness to their covenant and said: “Allah is a Trustee over what we say.” [Yusuf: 66] When their journey for provisions was settled, Jacob advised them not to enter through one gate, but to enter through separate gates. This was either out of fear of the evil eye (envy) upon them if they were all together and known to be the sons of one man, or out of fear that they would all be surrounded if evil was intended for them. However, Jacob made it clear that caution does not avert the decree, and his concern for their safety would not benefit them if Allah had intended harm for them. The decree of Allah is executed, and the judgment of Allah is dominant. Allah alone is the Judge, and upon Him I rely and trust. It is incumbent upon every believer that his reliance and trust be upon Allah alone; there is no god but Him, and no Lord besides Him. The caravan set off and reached Egypt. And when they entered from where their father had commanded them, through the separate gates, even though what Jacob had said was true (that it would not avail them against the will of Allah), for Allah alone is the Protector. But Allah the Blessed and Most High benefited them with what He inspired in their father, and what God taught him. Thus, Jacob's advice to his sons was a rightful piece of advice, “but most of the people do not know.” [Yusuf: 68]. The evil eye is real, as Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated in their *Sahihs* on the authority of Abu Hurayrah, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “The evil eye is a reality.” Similarly, Muslim narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “The evil eye is a reality. And if there were anything that could precede the decree, it would be the evil eye.” Allah the Blessed and Most High mentioned the coming of Joseph's brothers and their entering upon him, and what happened concerning the measure and the hiding of the merchandise in their vessels and bags, the request for their half-brother, their return to their father, his urging regarding Benjamin until he agreed to send him with them, their father's advice to them upon their entry, the confirmation that the entire matter belongs to Allah, that caution does not avert the decree, and the indication that the evil eye is real, by saying: “And the brothers of Joseph came and entered upon him, and he recognized them, while to him they were unrecognizable. And when he had furnished them with their provisions, he said: 'Bring me a brother of yours from your father. Do you not see that I give full measure and that I am the best of hosts? But if you do not bring him to me, no measure will you have with me, nor will you approach me.' They said: 'We will try to obtain him from his father, and indeed, we will do it.' And he said to his servants: 'Put their merchandise into their bags, so they may recognize it when they go back to their people, that they may return.' So when they returned to their father, they said: 'O our father! [Further] measure has been withheld from us. So send with us our brother that we may obtain measure, and indeed, we will be his guardians.' He said: 'Should I entrust you with him except as I entrusted you with his brother before? But Allah is the Best of Guardians, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.' And when they opened their baggage, they found their merchandise returned to them. They said: 'O our father! What more could we desire? This is our merchandise returned to us. We will get food for our family and guard our brother and receive an extra measure of a camel's load. That is an easy quantity.' He said: 'I will never send him with you until you give me a solemn covenant by Allah that you will bring him [back] to me, unless you are surrounded [by death].' And when they had given their solemn covenant, he said: 'Allah is a Trustee over what we say.' And he said: 'O my sons! Do not enter from one gate but enter from separate gates. But I cannot avail you against [the decree of] Allah at all. The [final] decision is only for Allah. Upon Him I have relied, and upon Him let those who would rely [indeed] rely.' And when they entered from where their father had commanded them, it did not avail them against [the decree of] Allah at all except [it was] a need in the soul of Jacob, which he satisfied. And indeed, he was possessed of knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most of the people do not know.” [Yusuf: 58-68] Allah the Blessed and Most High indicated that when Joseph's brothers entered upon him with their brother Benjamin, and Joseph welcomed them in a way that relieved their hearts and reassured their souls, he whispered to Benjamin and said: “Indeed, I am your brother, Joseph, so do not grieve over what they used to do.” [Yusuf: 69]. He commanded him not to inform them that this *Aziz* was their brother. He conspired with him to devise a ruse to keep him with him, and made him understand that the reunion of all the loved ones was near, due to the plan Joseph had devised and managed so that all his family, headed by his father Jacob, would come to him. When he had furnished them with their provisions and given them their full measure, along with an extra camel load, he placed the drinking cup, which was the “King's measuring bowl,” in his brother Benjamin's bag, without any of his servants or others seeing it. When Joseph's young men missed the cup and it was widely rumored that it had been stolen, a caller cried out: “O people of the caravan! Indeed, you are thieves!” [Yusuf: 70]. The people of the caravan, including Joseph's brothers, were alarmed and approached them, saying: “What is it you are missing?” They said: “We are missing the King's measuring bowl.” [Yusuf: 72]. It was not Joseph who called out, nor did he order the caller. Rather, the person responsible for safeguarding his property was the one who called out or ordered the caller. Let no one say: “How could it be appropriate for Joseph, despite his high rank and honorable position of Prophethood and Messengership, to accuse people of theft when they were innocent?” Because Joseph's action was limited to placing the cup in his brother's bag, which is not blameworthy. As for the caller or the one who ordered the call, it was not Joseph. The people of the caravan said to the one who called out the loss of the cup: “By Allah, you certainly know that we did not come to cause corruption in the land, and we have not been thieves.” [Yusuf: 73]. Like us, with our need for you, do not cause corruption in your land or steal from it. The officials responsible for safeguarding the grain and goods said: “Then what is its recompense, if you should be proved to have lied in your claim that the cup is not with you, and the King's cup is found in the bag of one of you?” They said: “The recompense is that the one in whose bag it is found—he himself shall be its recompense. Thus do we recompense the wrongdoers.” [Yusuf: 75]. It was then that Joseph began the search and inspection of their bags before the bag of his brother and his own vessel. If he had started with his brother's bag, it might have occurred to them that it was a trick to take their brother. So, he delayed the inspection of his brother's bag to dispel this thought from them, and then he took it out of his brother's bag. This is what Allah the Most High means by: “Thus did We plan for Joseph.” [Yusuf: 76]. That is, We inspired Joseph's brothers to decree that the one who stole the cup should be taken in recompense, just as We inspired Joseph to hide the cup in his brother's bag. This plot by Joseph was a desirable stratagem that Allah loves and approves. But Allah elevates in degrees whom He wills among His servants, and “over every possessor of knowledge is one [more] knowing.” [Yusuf: 76]. To the next chapter, God willing, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. * ## The Stories of the Prophets: The True Narration ### Continuation of (the story of) Joseph the Truthful I mentioned at the end of the previous chapter Joseph's stratagem to keep his brother Benjamin with him. Concerning this, Allah says: “So when they entered upon Joseph, he took his brother aside to himself, saying, 'Indeed, I am your brother, so do not grieve over what they used to do.' And when he had furnished them with their provisions, he put the measuring bowl into the bag of his brother. Then an announcer proclaimed, 'O caravan, indeed you are thieves.' They turned back and said, 'What is it you are missing?' They said, 'We are missing the King's measuring bowl, and for he who brings it is the load of a camel, and I guarantee it.' They said, 'By Allah, you certainly know that we did not come to cause corruption in the land, and we have not been thieves.' They said, 'Then what is its recompense, if you should be proved to have lied?' They said, 'Its recompense is that the one in whose bag it is found—he himself shall be its recompense. Thus do we recompense the wrongdoers.' So he began [the search] with their bags before the bag of his brother; then he extracted it from his brother's bag. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother under the law of the king except that Allah willed. We raise in degrees whom We will, but over every possessor of knowledge is one [more] knowing.” [Yusuf: 69-76] When Joseph's brothers saw that the measuring bowl was found in Benjamin's bag, they began to speak ill of him and Joseph, saying: “If he has stolen, a brother of his stole before.” [Yusuf: 77]. They intended to imply that Joseph had stolen their father's heart from them, or that out of their hatred for Joseph due to their father's love for him, they insulted and blamed him, not ceasing to abuse him. Therefore, Joseph said to himself, secretly from his brothers: “You are in a worse position, and Allah is most knowing of what you describe.” [Yusuf: 77]. They said: “O Aziz! Indeed, he has a father, a very old man, who cannot bear his absence. So take one of us in his place. Indeed, we see you as a doer of good.” Joseph said: “God forbid that we should take other than him with whom we found our property. Indeed, we would then be wrongdoers.” [Yusuf: 79]. Joseph had no need for any of them except Benjamin. When they despaired of freeing their brother Benjamin, whom they had obligated themselves and promised their father to return to him, they withdrew to confer among themselves about what to do. The eldest of them said: “Do you not know that your father has taken upon you an oath by Allah?” [Yusuf: 80] to bring him back, unless you are surrounded. “So I will not leave this land until my father permits me or Allah decides for me, and He is the best of judges.” [Yusuf: 80]. Meaning until Allah decrees a judgment for me, either by my death or by the release of my brother, and Allah is the Best of Judges. He then commanded them to inform their father of what had happened so that they would have an excuse, saying to him: “Your son was accused of theft and taken because of it. And we did not testify except to what we knew and what was manifest to everyone around us from the people of the caravan and the village. And we were not guardians of the unseen. And ask the caravan which we came with and the town in which we were. And indeed, we are truthful.” [Yusuf: 82]. So they arrived at their father and informed him of what their eldest brother had advised them. Jacob replied to them as he had replied to them when they came with the false blood on Joseph's shirt. He said to them: “Rather, your souls have enticed you to [do] something. So, patience is most fitting.” [Yusuf: 83]. He hoped that Allah would bring Joseph, Benjamin, and their eldest brother back to him, and said: “Perhaps Allah will bring them to me all together. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise.” [Yusuf: 83]. Jacob turned away from them and said: “Oh, my sorrow over Joseph!” [Yusuf: 84]. His grief intensified until his eyes turned white from sorrow, as the grief for the latter two renewed the grief for Joseph. However, he contained his anger and refrained from complaining to anyone but Allah. Nevertheless, his grief for Joseph stirred up their hidden resentment. They said: “By Allah, you will not cease remembering Joseph until you become fatally ill (on the verge of death and ruin) or become among the perishing.” He said: “I only complain of my suffering (my great sorrow and grief) and my grief to Allah, and I know from Allah that which you do not know,” [Yusuf: 86] (that Joseph is alive and may be in Egypt). “O my sons, go and find out about Joseph and his brother and do not despair of the relief (mercy) of Allah. Indeed, no one despairs of the relief of Allah except the disbelieving people.” [Yusuf: 87]. So they set out once more for Egypt in search of Joseph, and to complain of the distress that had afflicted them to the *Aziz* of Egypt and to ask for provisions. When they entered upon Joseph, they said: “O Aziz, adversity has touched us and our family, and we have brought an inferior (bad quality) amount of merchandise. So give us full measure and be charitable to us. Indeed, Allah rewards the charitable.” [Yusuf: 88] Joseph said to them: “Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?” [Yusuf: 89]. When they heard him mention what they had done to Joseph, they scrutinized him, and it occurred to them that he was Joseph. They said: “Are you indeed Joseph?” [Yusuf: 90]. He said: “I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has certainly favored us with honor and esteem. Indeed, he who fears [Allah] and is patient—then indeed, Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good.” [Yusuf: 90]. They then showed remorse for what they had done and said: “By Allah, truly Allah has preferred you over us, and indeed, we were sinful (wrongdoers) in what we did.” He said: “No blame will there be upon you this day. May Allah forgive you; and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.” [Yusuf: 92]. Having learned that his father's eyes had turned white from grief, he said to his brothers: “Take this shirt of mine and cast it over the face of my father; he will become visual. And bring me your whole family.” [Yusuf: 93]. This indicates that grief affects and harms the eye, and joy affects the eye with health and well-being. That is why Al-Khansa' said about herself concerning Sakhr: > *Is it a mote in your eyes, or is there a disease in the eye? Or did it shed tears when the home became empty of its people?* As soon as the caravan departed from the land of Egypt with Joseph's shirt, Jacob perceived the scent (smell) of Joseph. He said to those of his sons and grandchildren who were present: “Indeed, I find the scent of Joseph, though you might deem me a simpleton (foolish and in my old obsession).” [Yusuf: 94]. They said: “By Allah, indeed you are in your old delusion (passion)!” [Yusuf: 95]. But when the bearer of good tidings arrived and cast it over his face, he returned [to his sight] as clear. He said: “Did I not tell you that I know from Allah that which you do not know?” [Yusuf: 96]. They said: “O our father, ask forgiveness for us for our sins. Indeed, we were sinners.” [Yusuf: 97]. He said: “I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.” [Yusuf: 98]. Then they all set out for Egypt. Allah reunited their family. When they entered upon Joseph, he took his parents to himself (his father and his aunt, or his father and his mother, according to the opinion that she was alive until that time), and said: “Enter Egypt, if Allah wills, safely.” [Yusuf: 99]. He raised his parents upon the throne, and they all fell down prostrate before him in gratitude to Allah for His grace and for the honor He had bestowed upon Joseph. Joseph said to his father: “O my father, this is the interpretation of my vision of old. My Lord has made it reality. And He was certainly good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you from the desert after Satan had caused discord between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise.” [Yusuf: 100]. He also said, when the favor upon Joseph was complete and Allah had given him sovereignty, and he was asking Allah to join him with the righteous: “My Lord, You have given me [a share] of sovereignty and taught me the interpretation of dreams. Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my Protector in this world and in the Hereafter. Cause me to die in submission [to You] and join me with the righteous.” [Yusuf: 101]. “That is from the news of the unseen (Al-Ghayb) which We reveal to you, [O Muhammad]. And you were not with them when they put together their plan while they conspired.” [Yusuf: 102] To the next chapter, God willing, and peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.",

  "texte_original":"We speak of Noah (peace be upon him), one of the Ulu’l-Azm (resolute) messengers, and the first prophet to warn against polytheism and the worship of other than Allah. His nation was the first nation to engage in polytheism on Earth. Some may call Noah “the second Adam,” because, as God Almighty said, all those remaining on Earth are from his progeny: \"And We made his offspring the survivors.\" [As-Saffat: 77] People have differed regarding the period between Adam and Noah (peace be upon them). According to the People of the Book, Noah was born a hundred and six years after Adam’s death. Ibn Jarir mentioned that Noah was born 126 years after Adam’s death, and they listed eight forefathers in his lineage back to Adam. All these narrations regarding the period between Adam and Noah, as well as his lineage, are unsupported and speculative. It is authentically reported in Sahih al-Bukhari from Ibn Abbas that: there were ten generations between Adam and Noah, all of them practicing Islam. If by “generation” a century is meant, then the period between Adam and Noah was about a thousand years. If “generation” refers to a people’s era, then it spans thousands of years, since people before Noah lived very long lives. The exact duration is known only to Allah. Ibn Abbas clarified that humanity went through ten generations following Adam, all worshiping Allah alone, without associating partners with Him, until Satan introduced polytheism and led them to various forms of worship of other than Allah. They worshiped idols, and to these polytheists, God sent Noah. Al-Bukhari narrated from Ibn Abbas in interpreting the verse: \"And they said, 'We will not forsake our gods, nor will we abandon Wadd, nor Suwa’, nor Yaghuth, nor Ya’uq, nor Nasr.'\" [Noah: 23] Ibn Abbas explained: these were names of righteous men from Noah’s people. When they died, Satan inspired their people to erect statues at the places where they used to sit and name the statues after them. They followed this until they themselves perished, after which the idols were worshiped. The five idols mentioned in this verse do not indicate that these were the only ones worshiped; Noah’s people worshiped many other idols. God indicated this in His words: \"Nor will we forsake Wadd, nor Suwa’, nor Yaghuth, nor Ya’uq, nor Nasr.\" [Noah: 23] Amr ibn Lahi al-Khuza’i transported these idols to the Arabian Peninsula, keeping the names of Noah’s people’s idols, and called for their worship. For example, Banu ‘Adrah took Wadd and placed it in Dumat al-Jandal until Islam arrived and Khalid ibn al-Walid destroyed it. Similarly, Mudar ibn Nizar took Suwa’ and placed it in Batn Nakhlah, where Hudhail worshiped it until Islam came and destroyed it. Madh’hij took Yaghuth and set it on a hill in their land, until Islam came. Hamdan took Ya’uq and set it in a village called Khaywan, worshiped until Islam destroyed it. Himyar took Nasr and placed it in a location in Saba’, where it was worshiped until Islam arrived. God Almighty narrated Noah’s story in various chapters of the Qur’an: in Surah Al-A’raf, Yunus, Hud, Al-Anbiya, Al-Mu’minun, Ash-Shu’ara, Al-Ankabut, As-Saffat, and in the complete Surah of Noah. Noah is also mentioned among the messengers throughout the Qur’an. There is no doubt that he is one of the Ulu’l-Azm prophets. One of the main benefits of the stories of the prophets is to learn lessons and emulate them, and avoid what they warned against. God extended Noah’s story in two places in the Qur’an: in Surah Hud and Surah Noah. Studying the language and expressions of this story reveals unique and powerful methods of calling to Allah, guiding people, and exposing the opposition of the disbelievers and enemies of God. God began Noah’s story in Surah Hud with: \"And indeed We sent Noah to his people, [saying], 'Indeed, I am to you a clear warner.'\" [Hud: 25] This teaches that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is not a new messenger, nor the first warner; he followed the same path as the prophets before him. God highlighted this in Surah Hud regarding Hud: \"And remember ‘Aad, when He warned their people in the Ahqaf, but the warners before them and after them said, 'Do not worship except Allah. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day.'\" [Al-Ahqaf: 21] The sending of messengers is part of human nature, passed down through generations, so that people know that Allah sends messengers to guide His servants to happiness in this world and the next, and to prevent people from claiming, “No bringer of good tidings or warner has come to us.” After mentioning that Noah was a messenger, the Qur’an emphasizes the main mission of all messengers: calling people to the exclusive worship of Allah. \"And indeed We sent Noah to his people, [saying], 'Indeed, I am to you a clear warner, that you not worship except Allah.'\" [Hud: 25–26] This is the approach of all prophets: to call their people to monotheism, since worshiping Allah alone is the purpose for which He created the heavens and the earth, humans and jinn: \"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me. I do not want from them any provision, nor do I want them to feed Me. Indeed, Allah is the [one] Provider, the Possessor of Strength, the Firm.\" [Ad-Dhariyat: 56–58] After Noah called his people to worship Allah alone and warned them of the punishment in the Hereafter, the arrogant leaders of the earth presented three objections to divert people from his call. God refuted their arguments and exposed their falsehood, revealing the fate of the deniers. \"And indeed We sent Noah to his people, [saying], 'Indeed, I am to you a clear warner that you not worship except Allah. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day.'\" The leaders of his people said: \"We do not see you except as a man like us, and we do not see anyone following you except the weakest among us.\" [Hud: 27] These objections reflect arrogance, as the elite opposed Noah to protect their social positions from the new religion. Their objections were: Noah is only human. His followers are poor, and poverty is equated with weakness and ignorance. Noah and his followers have no physical or social superiority over others. God addressed such objections in multiple places in the Qur’an, emphasizing that messengers being human is not a weakness, because it allows them to communicate in the language of their people. If angels had been sent instead, people could not interact and benefit as they do with a human messenger. \"And if there were angels walking on the earth, We would have sent down to them an angel.\" [Al-Isra’: 94–95] Even Gabriel came to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) sometimes in human form so that people could interact naturally. Another objection of Noah’s people was that his followers were poor. The Qur’an emphasizes that wealth is not a measure of intellect or righteousness, and poverty does not equate to weakness of judgment: \"And We see that you are followed only by those who are lowly and poor.\" [Hud: 27] Allah demonstrates that He provides wealth and knowledge according to His will. The companions of prophets were often among the poor, as confirmed in authentic hadiths, showing that true support of the messenger comes from piety, not wealth or social rank. The Qur’an recounts examples of the elite and leaders of Quraysh in the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who rejected him and were arrogant, contrasting them with the believers, often from humble backgrounds, who were saved and rewarded. God Almighty has explained that the arrogant among Noah’s people opposed his message, as the powerful always begin by opposing the prophets, not because they reject the truth per se, but because they fear losing their positions and influence. Hence, it is said: “The eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said, ‘We do not see you except as a man like ourselves…’” [Hud: 27] The “eminent” here refers to the leaders and nobles of the people. It is remarkable that they denied his prophethood simply because he was human. This objection is the same that the enemies of all messengers have raised throughout history: whenever a messenger comes, people deny him on the grounds that he is only human. They fail to recognize that sending a human messenger is one of God’s greatest favors, because he speaks their language, understands their circumstances, and can guide them directly. Had God sent an angel instead, people would not have been able to interact with him in the same way. This is why God says in the Qur’an: “And what prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them except that they said, ‘Has Allah sent a human messenger?’” [Al-Isra: 94] If God had sent a messenger in the form of an angel, people could not have benefited from him, as humans are not prepared to accompany angels in worldly life. Likewise, Gabriel sometimes came to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in human form, such as the form of Dihya al-Kalbi or a man from the Bedouins, so people would not recognize him. The Prophet would inform them of his identity only after the revelation ended. It is narrated in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim from Umar ibn al-Khattab that Gabriel once came in a very white robe with very black hair, without any sign of travel. He asked the Prophet about Islam, faith, and Ihsan, and the Prophet answered. After the dialogue, Gabriel revealed his identity. This shows that messengers are specially prepared for interaction with angels, which ordinary humans could not handle. Similarly, in the Hereafter, only believers are ready to accompany angels. The angels who punish the disbelievers in Hell are strict and do not disobey God. When revelation descended upon the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), he would sweat even in cold weather due to the intensity of the experience, as Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) described. His neck would sweat like molten pearls, showing the immense burden of receiving divine revelation, for which God had prepared him. The second objection of the disbelievers of Noah’s people was that his followers were the poor. God mentions in the Qur’an: “And we do not see you followed except by the least among us…” [Hud: 27] This is a strange objection, based on the assumption that wealth indicates wisdom or intelligence. Yet there is no necessary link between wealth and intellect, knowledge, or piety; all provisions are granted by God to whomever He wills. Indeed, it is mentioned that the followers of the prophets are often among the poor, as in the example of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): Suhaib, Ammar, Bilal, Jamil ibn Asraqa, and Khabbab. They were raised in status after faith and admitted to Paradise, while the leaders and nobles who disbelieved were condemned to Hell. God also mentions that the Qur’an was not revealed to a wealthy man from the tribes of Mecca or Ta’if, but to a man of average social standing, Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Qur’an rebukes those who preferred wealth and status over divine guidance: “Do they swear by the mercy of your Lord? We have apportioned their livelihood in this life and raised some above others in ranks that they may compete therein…” [Az-Zukhruf: 31] Thus, God clarifies the corrupt thinking of the disbelievers, emphasizing that His mercy is better than all worldly possessions. Noah’s people also rejected his message because of their arrogance and pride. They said: “We do not believe in you” [Hud: 27] Arrogance has always been the root cause of denial. People refuse guidance when it threatens their pride, power, or comfort. In the case of Noah’s people, they had built a society based on wealth, status, and oppression, so accepting Noah’s message of monotheism and justice would have overturned their social order. God responded to their rejection by warning them of His punishment. The Qur’an describes the events leading to the Flood: “So We sent upon them a flood of water, and We saved Noah and those with him in the ark, and We drowned the others…” [Al-Ankabut: 14] This illustrates God’s justice: those who deny His signs and continue in arrogance are punished, while the believers are protected. The story of Noah also teaches patience and steadfastness in the face of opposition. Noah preached for centuries, yet only a few followed him. His perseverance became a model for all prophets and believers. Furthermore, the story highlights the importance of taking action in accordance with divine guidance. Noah did not wait for all people to believe; he built the ark and prepared for the flood as God commanded. This shows that faith must be coupled with effort and preparation. God’s message through Noah also emphasizes the universal principle of accountability. Each person is responsible for their choices, and no one can bear the sins of another. Even the closest family members cannot save someone from divine judgment if they persist in disbelief. Finally, the story concludes with a reminder of mercy: even after the flood, God allowed humanity to continue through Noah’s family, showing that His punishment is measured and His mercy abundant. The cycle of warning, punishment, and mercy is repeated throughout the Qur’an to guide humanity",

  "texte_original":"In this chapter, we speak about Jacob, the Prophet of Allah, son of Isaac. In the previous chapter, it was mentioned that Allah, exalted be He, gave the glad tidings to His Prophet (peace be upon them). It was previously indicated in the Qur’an that Sarah was given the glad tidings of Isaac, and through Isaac came Jacob. Allah, in the narration, indicated that Jacob is the son of Isaac, as also confirmed by the Prophet, which is narrated in Al-Bukhari. Jacob is Israel, and all the tribes belong to him. The meaning of Israel in Hebrew is “the servant of God,” combining the words “Isra” (servant) and “El” (God). In many languages, this name exists, but the Arabs adapted it to classical Arabic as “Isma‘il” or “Isma‘ain,” by changing the “l” to “n,” as they did in other stories. Regarding the story of Jacob and his children, many accounts are mentioned in the Qur’an. Allah, exalted be He, spoke of his wife and the fact that Jacob married more than one wife. He spoke about Joseph, whom his brothers from the same father envied because Jacob had a strong affection for him. Joseph had a full brother, as indicated in the Qur’an: \"From your father, Joseph.\" [Yusuf: 59] Jacob was very attached to Joseph and could hardly bear being away from him. Satan fueled the jealousy of Joseph’s brothers, and they plotted against him, intending either to kill him or to throw him into a distant place away from their father, so that they could have their father’s attention for themselves. They decided not to kill him but to throw him into a deep well so that passing travelers could take him to a distant land, claiming to their father that a wolf had devoured him: \"Why would you not guard Joseph? Send him with us tomorrow; we will surely protect him.\" [Yusuf: 11-12] Jacob’s attachment to Joseph was evident; he feared for him from the wolf: \"Indeed, it grieves me that you should take him, and I fear that the wolf will eat him while you are heedless of him.\" [Yusuf: 13-18] The Qur’an also mentions the story of Joseph’s brothers arriving in Egypt, not recognizing him, and Joseph asking them to bring their youngest brother from their father: \"Send with us our brother so that we may protect him; indeed, we will be his guardians.\" [Yusuf: 63-64] Jacob replied: \"I will not send him with you until you give me a promise in the name of Allah that you will be responsible for him.\" When they gave him their promise, he said: \"Allah is sufficient as a guardian over what you say.\" And Allah instructed: \"Do not enter by one gate, but enter through separate gates. Nothing will avail you from Allah except that which He wills. Upon Him, I rely, and upon Him let the reliant rely.\" [Yusuf: 66-68] When they entered as their father instructed, it did not benefit them except as part of a destined plan by Allah, which they did not perceive. Joseph, upon seeing his brothers, revealed himself: \"I am your brother, so do not grieve over what they were doing.\" [Yusuf: 69] Joseph placed a drinking vessel in his brother’s bag as a pretext to detain him, and his brothers tried to substitute another brother in his place, but Joseph refused: \"Do you not know that your father has taken a promise from Allah? Take one of us in his place; indeed, we are righteous.\" [Yusuf: 78] When they despaired of deceiving him, Joseph was freed. The eldest said: \"Did you not know that your father has taken a promise from Allah and that previously you tried to wrong Joseph?\" Jacob’s sons then returned to their father and said: \"O our father, your son has stolen. We only testify to what we know, and we were not aware of the unseen. We bring back the caravan and the town as we found them; indeed, we speak the truth.\" [Yusuf: 80-82] Jacob said: \"It was your own selves who planned this. So patience is beautiful; perhaps Allah will bring them all back to me. He is the Knowing, the Wise.\" He turned away from them, grieving for Joseph, and his eyes turned white from sorrow, holding deep sadness in his heart: \"By Allah, you will keep mentioning Joseph until you become weary,\" said his sons. [Yusuf: 85] Jacob said: \"I only complain of my sorrow and grief to Allah, and I know from Him that which you do not know. My sons, go and inquire about Joseph and his brother, and do not despair of Allah’s mercy; only the disbelieving despair of Allah’s mercy.\" [Yusuf: 86-87] When they entered to Joseph and explained the grief that had befallen their father over the separation from his son, Joseph revealed himself to them and instructed them to bring his shirt to place over his father’s face to remove his grief and restore his sight. He also instructed them to bring all their family. When the curtain was removed, Jacob said to his sons: \"Indeed, I perceive the springtime of Joseph.\" When the bearer of good news brought Joseph’s shirt to his father, his sight was restored, and he said to his sons: \"Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you do not know?\" They said: \"O our father, ask forgiveness for us. Indeed, we have been sinners.\" He said: \"I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord; He is indeed the Forgiving, the Merciful.\" When they entered to Joseph, he embraced his father and his uncle (the mother of his siblings on his father’s side) or other close relatives, placing them in safety: \"Enter Egypt in safety. We raised your parents on the throne, and they fell down in prostration.\" [Yusuf: 99-100] They prostrated to Allah in gratitude. Joseph said: \"This is the interpretation of my two dreams from before; my Lord has made it true, and He has done well by me when He brought you to me after Satan sowed discord between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills; He is the Knowing, the Wise.\" [Yusuf: 101",

  "texte_original":"In this chapter, we talk about Ṣāliḥ, the prophet and messenger of Allah. He was the second Arab messenger after Hūd, may peace and blessings be upon them. Allah sent him to the Arabian Peninsula, specifically to his people, Thamūd. Scholars of genealogy have mentioned that he was Ṣāliḥ ibn ʿUbaid ibn Asīf ibn Māshikh or Māsiḥ ibn ʿUbaid ibn Ḥājir, or Ḥādir ibn Thamūd ibn ʿĀbir, or ʿĀthir ibn Iram ibn Sām ibn Nūḥ. His people lived in the region of Al-Ḥijr, known as Diyar Thamūd or Madā’in Ṣāliḥ, located about 380–400 km northwest of Medina. In the south of this region is today the city of Al-ʿUlā. Some of its wells still exist, notably the famous “Well of the She-Camel.” The remains of Thamūd, including houses and graves, are still present, especially the houses they carved into the mountains. The Thamūd lived peacefully in expansive, shaded gardens with abundant water sources, crops, and palm trees with plentiful dates. They built palaces in the plains and carved houses from the mountains with remarkable skill, craftsmanship, and decoration. Allah had provided them with the means for a prosperous life. They were one of the nations that came after the people of Hūd and were aware of their history, as well as the punishment Allah had inflicted on those who disbelieved and worshiped idols. However, despite the blessings, the Thamūd rejected Allah’s signs and denied His favors. So Allah sent to them a messenger from among themselves: Ṣāliḥ, peace be upon him. He called them to worship Allah alone, to recognize His oneness, acknowledge His Lordship, and affirm His perfect names and attributes. He reminded them of Allah’s favors and warned them of His punishment, indicating that persisting in shirk (associating partners with Allah) and denying blessings could bring upon them the same fate as the people of Hūd. The weak among them believed and turned to Allah, while the arrogant refused to submit and said: \"Ṣāliḥ was among us a trustworthy man before this. Did he not forbid us from worshiping what our ancestors worshiped? And we are in doubt about what you call us to?\" [Hūd: 62] They asked for a miracle. Allah produced a camel from the rock. Ṣāliḥ said to them: \"This is Allah’s camel for you, a sign. Let it graze on Allah’s land and do not harm it, or a severe punishment will strike you soon.\" [Hūd: 64] One of the miracles of this camel was that it drank nearly all the water. Ṣāliḥ divided the water between the people and the camel: on some days, the camel drank alone, and on others, the people drank while the camel did not. Although this miracle was a clear proof of Ṣāliḥ’s truthfulness, the arrogant persisted in their rebellion and disbelief. They tried to prevent the believers from following Ṣāliḥ and spread doubts about his message. Allah withheld rain as a warning. The arrogant said: \"Ṣāliḥ is the reason for the drought in our land, and his presence brings misfortune. Following the believers with him destroys the blessings of our land and water.\" Ṣāliḥ replied: \"Your fate is with Allah.\" [An-Naml: 47] Allah’s messengers bring goodness and prosperity, guiding people to repentance and divine mercy. Allah says: \"If you do not seek forgiveness from Allah, perhaps you will be shown mercy.\" [An-Naml: 46] But they did not respond, and they said to the believers: \"Do you know that Ṣāliḥ is sent by his Lord?\" [Al-Aʿrāf: 75] The arrogant replied: \"We do not believe in what you believe.\" [Al-Aʿrāf: 76] They plotted to kill Ṣāliḥ and attacked the camel. Nine of them persisted in killing the camel and planned to murder Ṣāliḥ. Allah struck them with a violent cry and an earthquake, destroying them entirely, while Ṣāliḥ and the believers were saved by Allah’s mercy. The Qur’an states: \"They plotted, but We planned against them, and their entire people was destroyed.\" [An-Naml: 50–51] \"When Our command came, We saved Ṣāliḥ and those who believed with him by Our mercy. On the day of punishment, your Lord is mighty and invincible. The wrongdoers were seized in their homes.\" [Hūd: 66–68] They killed the camel and defied their Lord’s command. Allah struck them with a single scream, annihilating them in their houses, leaving only ruins behind. The Qur’an notes that Thamūd and Hūd are not mentioned in any Jewish or Christian scriptures, indicating an attempt to erase all memory of prophethood among the Arab people out of jealousy and aversion. The Qur’an also shows that the prophet Moses, peace be upon him, warned his people so that they would not suffer the same fate as the peoples of Hūd and Ṣāliḥ. In Surah Ibrāhīm: \"And Moses said: If you and all those on earth disbelieve, Allah is Rich and Praiseworthy. Did the news of those who came before you not reach you: the people of Nūḥ, ʿĀd, and Thamūd…?\" [Ibrāhīm: 10] Allah mentions Ṣāliḥ’s story in several parts of the Qur’an, each time suited to the context, often in connection with other prophets and messengers. In Surah Al-Aʿrāf: \"And to Thamūd, their brother Ṣāliḥ said: O my people, worship Allah. Here is Allah’s camel for you, a sign. Let it graze on the land and do not harm it. Remember how Allah established you on earth and facilitated your prosperity, and do not cause corruption. The arrogant among them said: We do not believe in what the weak among them believe. They killed the camel and disobeyed their Lord’s command. Then the earthquake seized them, and they were destroyed in their homes.\" [Al-Aʿrāf: 73–79] In Surah Hūd: \"And to Thamūd, their brother Ṣāliḥ said: O my people, worship Allah, who has made you prosperous on earth and facilitated your life. Repent and seek forgiveness from your Lord. But they said: Ṣāliḥ was among us a trustworthy man before this. We are in doubt about what you call us to.\" [Hūd: 61] Allah’s camel was a clear miracle. They killed it and faced a severe punishment. Allah saved Ṣāliḥ and the believers. The arrogant were annihilated, while the believers were protected. Surahs Al-Ḥijr, Al-Isrā’, Ash-Shu‘arā’, An-Naml, and Fuṣṣilat confirm this story, emphasizing the punishment of Thamūd, the truthfulness of Ṣāliḥ, and Allah’s power and mercy.",

  "texte_original":"In this chapter, we speak to you about the Imam of the Monotheists (Hounafa), the Father of the Prophets, and the Intimate Friend of the Most Merciful (Khalil Al-Rahman), the one who most closely resembled Muhammad in his physical and moral nature, one of the great masters among the Messengers of Strong Will (Ulu Al-'Azm), the Nation (Ummah), the Devout (Qanit), the Monotheist (Hanif), the Suppliant (Awwah), the Forbearing (Halim): Ibrahim (Abraham). His father Azar was from the progeny of Sam, son of Noah. Ibrahim was born in the land of Babylon, known as the land of the Chaldeans. His father and his people worshipped idols and statues, prostrated to the seven planets (stars), and erected temples for them. So, Allah sent to them the Imam of the Monotheists, Ibrahim. He called them to the obligation of sincerely devoting worship to Allah alone, and in his call, he adopted methods of guidance that established the proof and removed any doubt. Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, presented images of Ibrahim's methods of calling in his dialogue with his people, guiding them to Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He. Regarding this, He says: « And (mention) when Abraham said to Azar, his father, \"Do you take idols as deities? Indeed, I see you and your people to be in manifest error. \" And thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be of those with certainty. » [Al-An'am: 74-75] (Meaning: We showed him the way to deduce from Allah's cosmic signs in the heavens and the earth that there is no deity except Allah) « that he might be of those with certainty. » « So when the night covered him [with darkness], he saw a star. He said, \"This is my Lord. \" » (Meaning: Is this fit to be a Lord to be worshipped?) « But when it set, he said, \"I like not those that disappear. \" » [Al-An'am: 76] This is a wise method for shaking the foundations of their falsehood. « And when he saw the moon rising (Bâzighan), he said, \"This is my Lord. \" » (Meaning: Is this fit to be a Lord to be worshipped?) « But when it set, he said, \"Unless my Lord guides me, I will surely be among the misguided people. \" » [Al-An'am: 77] By this saying, he intended to gradually lead his people and inform them of their ignorance and their error in venerating and worshipping these setting heavenly bodies, and that the destiny of creation is in the Hand of Allah alone, so whoever Allah does not guide has no guide. « And when he saw the sun rising, he said, \"This is my Lord; this is greater. \" But when it set, he said, \"O my people, indeed I am free from what you associate with Allah. Indeed, I have turned my face toward Him who created (Fatara) the heavens and the earth, inclining toward truth (Hanîf) » [Al-An'am: 78-79] (Meaning: inclining towards the upright religion) « and I am not of the polytheists. \" » [Al-An'am: 79] The omission of the interrogative particle in a phrase like: \"This is my Lord? \" is permissible and common in the (Arabic) language, and it is an interrogation of denial and reproach to his people, the star worshippers. The omission of the interrogative particle has occurred in various places in the Noble Qur'an, including His saying (Exalted is He): « If you die, will they live forever? » [Al-Anbiya: 34] (Meaning: Will they live forever?) The Great Qur'an also points to his people's reaction to this conclusive argument: when they were defeated (by argument), they resorted to intimidating him with the wrath of their deities. Regarding this, Allah says: « And his people argued with him. He said, \"Do you argue with me concerning Allah while He has guided me? And I fear not what you associate with Him unless my Lord should will something. My Lord encompasses all things in knowledge; will you not then remember? And how should I fear what you have associated while you do not fear that you have associated with Allah that for which He has not sent down to you any authority? So which of the two parties is more deserving of [feeling] secure, if you should know? \" » [Al-An'am: 80-81] « They who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice - those will have [security] and they are [rightly] guided. » [Al-An'am: 82] « And that was Our [conclusive] argument which We gave Abraham against his people. We raise in degrees whom We will. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing. » [Al-An'am: 83] Allah (Praise be to Him) mentions another instance of Ibrahim's explanation that Allah alone is worthy of worship and that their other deities neither hear nor benefit nor harm. He says: « And recite to them the news of Abraham. When he said to his father and his people, \"What do you worship? \" » [Ash-Shu'ara: 69-70] He asked them about their deities in order to build on their answer that these gods do not deserve any worship, thereby cutting off their misconception. « They said, \"We worship idols and remain devoted to them. \" He said, \"Do they hear you when you supplicate? Or do they benefit or harm you? \" They said, \"But we found our fathers doing so. \" He said, \"Then do you see what you have been worshipping, you and your ancient fathers? Indeed, they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds, who created me, and He [it is who] guides me. And it is He who feeds me and gives me drink. And when I am ill, it is He who cures me. And He who will cause me to die and then will bring me to life. And [it is] He for whom I aspire that He will forgive me my sin on the Day of Recompense. \" » [Ash-Shu'ara: 71-82] « My Lord, grant me authority (Hukm) and join me with the righteous. And grant me a reputation of truth (a tongue of truth) among later generations. And make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Pleasure. And forgive my father, for indeed, he has been of those astray. » [Ash-Shu'ara: 83-86] This was due to a promise Ibrahim made, from which he understood that his father was close to faith. But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he disassociated from him, as Allah (Exalted is He) said: « And the supplication of Abraham for his father for forgiveness was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that his father was an enemy to Allah, he disassociated himself from him. Indeed, Abraham was one who was ever supplicating (Awwâh) and forbearing (Halîm). » [At-Tawbah: 114] Then Ibrahim continued his supplication to Allah and extended his call to his people, saying: « And disgrace me not on the Day they are resurrected - The Day when neither wealth nor sons will benefit - Except one who brings to Allah a sound heart. » [Ash-Shu'ara: 87-89] In a bright picture of how Ibrahim's call was presented and his position towards his people after his wife Sarah and Lot believed in him, Allah says: « There has already been for you an excellent pattern in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, \"Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have denied you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone \" » [Al-Mumtahanah: 4] (Meaning: So do not seek forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they are your close relatives) « - except for the saying of Abraham to his father, \"I will surely ask forgiveness for you \" » « but I possess not for you [the power to obtain] from Allah a thing. Our Lord, upon You we have relied, and to You we have returned, and to You is the destination. Our Lord, make us not a trial for those who have disbelieved, and forgive us, our Lord. Indeed, You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise. There has certainly been for you in them a good example for whoever would hope for Allah and the Last Day. And whoever turns away - then indeed, Allah is the Free of Need, the Praiseworthy. » [Al-Mumtahanah: 4-6] Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, describes a radiant instance of Ibrahim's interactions with his father Azar, saying: « And mention in the Book [the story of] Abraham. Indeed, he was a man of truth and a prophet. [Mention] when he said to his father, \"O my father, why do you worship that which neither hears nor sees nor avails you in anything? O my father, indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to a straight path. O my father, do not worship Satan. Indeed, Satan has ever been, to the Most Merciful, disobedient. O my father, indeed I fear that there will touch you a punishment from the Most Merciful so you would become to Satan a companion [in Hell]. \" [The father] said, \"Are you turning away from my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will surely stone you, so leave me for a prolonged time. \" [Abraham] said, \"Peace be upon you. I will ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Indeed, He has ever been to me gracious (Hafiyya - very kind to me, great in kindness). And I will leave you and that which you invoke other than Allah and will supplicate my Lord. It may be that I will not be deprived in [my] supplication to my Lord. \" » [Maryam: 41-48] In another instance of Ibrahim's interactions with his father and his people, Allah says: « And We had certainly given Abraham his sound judgment before, and We were of him all-knowing. [Mention] when he said to his father and his people, \"What are these statues to which you are devoted? \" They said, \"We found our fathers worshippers of them. \" He said, \"You have certainly been, you and your fathers, in manifest error. \" They said, \"Have you brought us the truth, or are you one of those who jest? \" He said, \"[No], rather, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, who created them, and I, to that, am of those who testify. And [I swear] by Allah, I will surely plan against your idols after you have turned and gone away. \" » [Al-Anbiya: 51-58] « So he made them into fragments, except a large one among them, that they might return to it [for inquiry]. They said, \"Who has done this to our gods? Indeed, he is among the wrongdoers. \" They said, \"We heard a young man mention them [with contempt] (meaning: criticize them and curse them) who is called Abraham. \" They said, \"Then bring him before the eyes of the people that they may testify. \" » [Al-Anbiya: 59-61] « They said, \"Have you done this to our gods, O Abraham? \" He said, \"Rather, this - the largest of them - did it. So ask them, if they should [be able to] speak. \" So they returned to [blaming] themselves and said, \"Indeed, you yourselves are the wrongdoers. \" Then they made him fall back on their heads [and said], \"You certainly know that these do not speak! \" He said, \"Do you then worship instead of Allah that which does not benefit you at all or harm you? Uff to you and to what you worship instead of Allah! Then will you not use reason? \" » [Al-Anbiya: 62-67] « They said, \"Burn him and support your gods, if you are to act. \" We said, \"O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham! \" And they intended for him a plot, but We made them the greatest losers. » [Al-Anbiya: 68-70] Allah recounts the story of the king of the Chaldeans in his interrogation of Ibrahim about his Lord. Ibrahim said: « My Lord is the one who gives life and causes death. » The king then presumed to say: \"I give life and cause death. \" Ibrahim then silenced him by saying: « Indeed, Allah brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west. » This disbeliever was bewildered. Regarding this, Allah says: « Have you not considered the one who argued with Abraham concerning his Lord [merely] because Allah had given him kingship? When Abraham said, \"My Lord is the one who gives life and causes death, \" he said, \"I give life and cause death. \" Abraham said, \"Then indeed, Allah brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west. \" So the disbeliever was overcome by astonishment. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. » [Al-Baqarah: 258] Some commentators have mentioned that this debate between Ibrahim and the king took place when Ibrahim came asking him for food, and the king refused to give it to him. Ibrahim's sorrow intensified as he approached his family's home, wondering how he could enter upon Sarah and his son Isaac without food. He resorted to a dune of sand and filled his two bags with it to console his family. When he slept, the sand turned into pure white flour. When Sarah opened the bag, she found the flour and made food from it. When Ibrahim woke up and found the food, he asked, \"Where did you get this? \" She said, \"From your bag. \" etc. This is an evident lie and has no basis, praise be to Allah, and Isaac was only born in Ash-Sham (Syria). Until the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Twenty-one: Continuation of Abraham Chapter Twenty-one Continuation of Abraham In the previous chapter, I mentioned bright examples of Ibrahim's call, and at the end of it, I recalled the debate between the Intimate Friend (Al-Khalil) and the king of the Chaldeans who argued with Ibrahim about his Lord, and how Ibrahim established the crushing argument, so the disbeliever was confounded. Ibrahim continued to pursue his call to his people to Allah, seeking to bring them out of the darkness into the light. Regarding this, Allah says: « And [We sent] Abraham, when he said to his people, \"Worship Allah and fear Him. That is better for you, if you should know. You only worship, besides Allah, idols, and you produce a falsehood. Indeed, those you worship besides Allah do not possess for you [the power of] provision. So seek provision from Allah and worship Him and be grateful to Him. To Him you will be returned. And if you deny [the message] - already have nations before you denied. And there is not upon the Messenger except [to deliver] the clear notification. \" » [Al-'Ankabut: 16-18] « Do they not see how Allah begins creation and then repeats it? Indeed, that, for Allah, is easy. Say, [O Muhammad], \"Travel through the land and observe how He began creation. Then Allah will produce the final creation. Indeed, Allah, over all things, is competent. \" » [Al-'Ankabut: 19-20] « He punishes whom He wills and grants mercy to whom He wills, and to Him you will be returned. And you will not cause failure [to Allah] upon earth or in the heaven. And there is not for you besides Allah any protector or any helper. And those who disbelieve in the signs of Allah and the meeting with Him - those have despaired of My mercy, and for them will be a painful punishment. » [Al-'Ankabut: 21-23] « So the answer of his people was only that they said, \"Kill him or burn him! \" But Allah saved him from the fire. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe. » [Al-'Ankabut: 24] « And [Abraham] said, \"You have only taken, besides Allah, idols as [a bond of] affection between you in worldly life. Then on the Day of Resurrection, you will deny one another and curse one another, and your refuge will be the Fire, and you will not have any helpers. \" » [Al-'Ankabut: 25-26] « So Lot believed in him. [Abraham] said, \"Indeed, I will emigrate to [the service of] my Lord. Indeed, He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. \" » [Al-'Ankabut: 26] Ibrahim emigrated with his wife Sarah and Lot to Ash-Sham (Syria). Regarding this, Allah says: « They said, \"Burn him and support your gods, if you are to act. \" We said, \"O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham! \" And they intended for him a plot, but We made them the greatest losers. And We saved him and Lot [by taking them] to the land which We had blessed for the worlds. » [Al-Anbiya: 68-71] The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pointed to the cooperation of the gecko\/lizard (Wazagh) with Ibrahim's people in attempting to burn him, and that the gecko was blowing on Ibrahim (the fire). It is reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from the Hadith of Umm Sharik (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the killing of the gecko. In Al-Bukhari's wording: \"It was blowing on Ibrahim. \" It is confirmed in the two Sahih collections (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"The Prophet Ibrahim was circumcised with an adze (Al-Qaddûm) when he was eighty years old. \" Ibrahim (peace be upon him) settled in Ash-Sham, which is the land of the Canaanites, along with his wife Sarah and Lot. Allah then sent Lot to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah and their surrounding areas in the circle of Jordan. Ibrahim and Sarah traveled to Egypt. The king of Egypt was informed of the beauty of Ibrahim's wife and was tempted by her. Allah saved her from him and gave her Hagar as a servant. Sarah then gave her to Ibrahim, and Allah blessed him with Ishmael (Isma'il) through her. Ibrahim returned with his family to the Holy Land in Palestine. A certain disagreement arose between Sarah and Hagar, due to what Allah had decreed: that her son Ishmael would build the Sacred House in Mecca with his father. Hagar fled from Sarah, and Allah commanded Ibrahim to take Hagar and Ishmael to Mecca. Hagar took a belt to tie around her waist, letting the end trail behind her to erase her tracks from Sarah. Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih from Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) who said: \"The first woman to use the belt was the mother of Ishmael. She used a belt to erase her tracks from Sarah. \" Then Ibrahim brought her and her son Ishmael, whom she was nursing, until he placed them near the House (Kaaba), by a large tree (Dawhah) above Zamzam in the upper part of the Mosque. There was no one in Mecca at that time, and there was no water. He placed them there and left a bag of dates and a water skin with them. Then Ibrahim turned away to leave. The mother of Ishmael followed him and said, \"O Ibrahim, where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is neither company nor anything? \" She repeated this to him several times, but he did not turn to look at her. She asked him, \"Did Allah command you to do this? \" He said, \"Yes. \" She said, \"Then He will not abandon us. \" Then she returned. Ibrahim continued until he reached the pass where they could no longer see him. He turned his face towards the House (Kaaba) and made these supplications, raising his hands and saying: « Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley » [Ibrahim: 37] until he reached « ... that they may be grateful. » Ishmael's mother continued to nurse Ishmael and drink from that water. When the water in the skin was depleted, she became thirsty and her son became thirsty. She started looking at him twisting, or he said: writhing. She left, hating to look at him, and found As-Safa the nearest mountain to her on earth. She stood upon it and faced the valley, looking to see if she could see anyone, but she did not see anyone. She descended from As-Safa, and when she reached the valley, she lifted the edge of her garment and ran with the running of a person exhausted until she crossed the valley. Then she came to Al-Marwah, stood upon it, and looked to see if she could see anyone, but she did not see anyone. She did this seven times. Ibn Abbas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"That is the running (Sa'y) of the people between them. \" When she was overlooking Al-Marwah, she heard a sound. She said: \"Hush! \" (meaning to herself), then she listened again and heard it again. She said, \"I have heard you, if you have help. \" Then she saw the Angel near the location of Zamzam. He dug with his heel, or he said: with his wing, until the water appeared. She began to encircle it with her hand and scoop water into her water skin, while the water was gushing after she scooped. Ibn Abbas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"May Allah have mercy on the mother of Ishmael. If she had left Zamzam (or he said: if she had not scooped from Zamzam), Zamzam would have been a flowing spring. \" He said: She drank and nursed her child. The Angel said to her: \"Do not fear abandonment, for here is a House of Allah which this boy and his father will build, and Allah does not abandon His people. \" The House (Kaaba) was elevated from the ground like a hill, and the torrents would take from its right and left. She remained like this until a group from Jurhum, or a family from Jurhum, came along the Kadda road. They settled in the lower part of Mecca. They saw a bird circling (Ta'ifan) and said, \"This bird is circling over water. We did not know of any water in this valley. \" They sent one or two scouts (Jariyyan or Jariyayn) and found the water. They returned and informed them, and they came forward. Ishmael's mother was by the water. They said, \"Do you permit us to settle with you? \" She said, \"Yes, but you have no right to the water. \" They said, \"Yes. \" Ibn Abbas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"This pleased the mother of Ishmael, as she liked company. \" So they settled and sent for their families, who settled with them. The boy grew up and learned Arabic from them, and they liked him and admired him when he came of age. When he reached maturity, they married him to a woman from their tribe. Ishmael's mother died. Ibrahim came after Ishmael got married to check on what he had left. He did not find Ishmael. He asked his wife about him, and she said, \"He went out to seek provision for us \" (and in another narration: \"to hunt for us \"). Then he asked her about their life and condition. She said, \"We are in a bad state, in distress and hardship. \" She complained to him. He said, \"When your husband comes, convey my greetings to him and tell him to 'change the doorstep of his door.' \" When Ishmael came, he sensed something (unusual). He asked, \"Has anyone visited you? \" She said, \"Yes, an old man of such and such appearance came to us. He asked about you, and I informed him. He asked me how our life was, and I told him we were in hardship and distress. \" He said, \"Did he recommend anything to you? \" She said, \"Yes, he ordered me to convey his greetings to you and to tell you to 'change the doorstep of your door.' \" He said, \"That was my father, and he has commanded me to leave you. Go back to your family. \" So he divorced her and married another woman from them. Ibrahim stayed away from them as long as Allah willed, then he came again and did not find him. He went in to his wife and asked her about him. She said, \"He went out to seek provision for us. \" He said, \"How are you? \" He asked her about their life and condition. She said, \"We are in goodness and ease, \" and she praised Allah. He asked, \"What is your food? \" She said, \"Meat. \" He asked, \"What is your drink? \" She said, \"Water. \" He said, \"O Allah, bless them in meat and water. \" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"There was no grain for them then, and if there had been, he would have supplicated for them regarding it. \" He said: \"These two (meat and water) are not suitable for anyone outside Mecca who relies on them. \" He said, \"When your husband comes, convey my greetings to him and order him to keep the doorstep of his door. \" When Ishmael came, he asked, \"Has anyone visited you? \" She said, \"Yes, an old man of good appearance came to us, \" and she praised him. \"He asked about you, and I informed him. He asked me how our life was, and I told him we were in goodness. \" He said, \"Did he recommend anything to you? \" She said, \"Yes, he conveys greetings to you and orders you to keep the doorstep of your door. \" He said, \"That was my father, and you are the doorstep. He commanded me to keep you. \" Then he stayed away from them as long as Allah willed. Then he came after that and found Ishmael sharpening his arrows under a large tree near Zamzam. When he saw him, he stood up and did as a father does with his son and a son with his father. He said, \"O Ishmael, Allah has commanded me to do something. \" He said, \"Do what your Lord has commanded you. \" He said, \"And will you help me? \" He said, \"And I will help you. \" He said, \"Indeed, Allah has commanded me to build a House here, \" and he pointed to a raised hill. At that moment, they raised the foundations of the House (Kaaba). Ishmael would bring the stones, and Ibrahim would build. When the building rose high, he brought that stone (Maqam Ibrahim) and placed it for him. He stood upon it to build, and Ishmael handed him the stones, and they both said: « Our Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing. » [Al-Baqarah: 127] Until the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Twenty-Two: Continuation of Abraham Chapter Twenty-Two Continuation of Abraham In the previous chapter, I referred to the coming of Ibrahim with his son Ishmael and Hagar to Mecca. I mentioned what Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih about this story, the upbringing of Ishmael, his relationship with the tribe of Jurhum, his learning of the Arabic language, and his helping his father Ibrahim in building the Sacred House (Al-Bayt Al-Haram). Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, mentioned the story of the building of the Kaaba in His Noble Book, where He says: « And [mention] when We designated for Abraham the site of the House, [saying], \"Do not associate anything with Me and purify My House for those who perform Tawaf and those who stand [in prayer] and those who bow and prostrate. And proclaim to the people the Hajj [pilgrimage]; they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every deep ravine - That they may witness benefits for themselves and mention the name of Allah on known days over what He has provided for them of [sacrificial] animals. So eat of them and feed the miserable and poor. Then let them end their untidiness and fulfill their vows and perform Tawaf around the ancient House (Al-Bayt Al-'Atiq). \" » [Al-Hajj: 26-29] And He said: « And [mention] when Abraham was tried by his Lord with commands and he fulfilled them. [Allah] said, \"Indeed, I will make you to the people an imam (leader). \" [Abraham] said, \"And of my descendants? \" [Allah] said, \"My covenant does not include the wrongdoers. \" » [Al-Baqarah: 124] « And [mention] when We made the House a place of return for the people and [a place of] security. And take, [O believers], from the standing place of Abraham (Maqam Ibrahim) a place of prayer. And We charged Abraham and Ishmael, [saying], \"Purify My House for those who perform Tawaf and those who are staying [there] for worship and those who bow and prostrate. \" And [mention] when Abraham said, \"My Lord, make this a secure city and provide its people with fruits - whoever of them believes in Allah and the Last Day. \" [Allah] said, \"And whoever disbelieves - I will grant him enjoyment for a little; then I will compel him to the punishment of the Fire, and wretched is the destination. \" And [mention] when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House and [so was] Ishmael, [saying], \"Our Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing. Our Lord, and make us Muslims [in submission] to You and from our descendants a Muslim nation [in submission] to You. And show us our rites [of pilgrimage] and accept our repentance. Indeed, You are the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful. Our Lord, and send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and the Wisdom and purify them. Indeed, You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise. \" » [Al-Baqarah: 124-129] Allah also referred to what Ibrahim did by placing Hagar and Ishmael near the site of the House, where He says: « Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near Your Sacred House, our Lord, that they may establish prayer. So make hearts among the people incline toward them and provide them with fruits that they may be grateful. » [Ibrahim: 37] Allah (Exalted is He) answered Ibrahim's supplication and made this House a safe sanctuary, to which the fruits of everything are brought, as He said: « Have We not established for them a safe sanctuary, to which are brought the fruits of all things as provision from Us? But most of them do not know. » [Al-Qasas: 57] And as He said: « Do they not see that We have made [Makkah] a safe sanctuary, while people are being snatched away all around them? » [Al-'Ankabut: 67] Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, also answered the supplication of His Intimate Friend, Ibrahim, by sending Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from the descendants of Ishmael, the people of the Sacred House, to recite to them the verses of Allah, teach them the Book and the Wisdom, and purify them. That is why it is mentioned in the Hasan Hadith that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"I am the supplication of my father Ibrahim, and the glad tidings of Jesus about me. And my mother saw that a light came out from her, illuminating for her the palaces of Ash-Sham (Syria). \" This is also found in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad from the Hadith of Abi Umamah and Al-'Irbad ibn Sariyah, the wording being that of Abi Umamah. Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, also mentioned the story of Ibrahim's emigration, the glad tidings of Ishmael, and the story of his vision of sacrificing him. He said: « And indeed, among his type (of Noah's) was Abraham. When he came to his Lord with a sound heart. [When] he said to his father and his people, \"What is it you worship? Is it falsehood - [as] deities besides Allah - that you want? Then what is your thought about the Lord of the worlds? \" And he cast a [contemplative] look at the stars And said, \"Indeed, I am sick. \" » [As-Saffat: 83-89] It is as if he wanted them to disperse and move away from him so he could attend to destroying their idols by making them think he was ill so they would not touch him, especially after his look at the stars. His look at the stars was not meant to learn his condition from the star, just as his saying, « Indeed, I am sick, » was not meant to mean he was afflicted with a contagious disease, but rather he meant in himself that he was weak, and every son of Adam is weak, regardless of his health. Man was created weak. This is an example of Tawriyah (ambiguity\/equivocation), and in Tawriyah there is a way out of lying (far be it from him to lie), although Tawriyah may be called a lie in consideration of the real intent, but it is not the blameworthy lie. It is like calling non-blameworthy envy (Ghibtah) jealousy (Hasad), as in the saying of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from the Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"There is no jealousy (Hasad) except in two [cases]: a man whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it rightfully, and a man whom Allah has given wisdom and he judges by it and teaches it. \" The general body of scholars interpreted jealousy (Hasad) in this Hadith as Ghibtah (non-blameworthy envy), as the blameworthy jealousy is wishing for the removal of a blessing from others. There is no doubt among the people of knowledge that Ibrahim's saying (peace be upon him): « Indeed, I am sick, » as well as his saying: « Rather, this - the largest of them - did it, » [Al-Anbiya: 63] and his saying to the king of Egypt about Sarah: \"She is my sister, \" is not considered by the scholars to be a blameworthy lie, but rather a matter of Tawriyah and Ambiguity (Ma'arid). Then Allah (Exalted is He) said: « So they turned away from him, retreating. » [As-Saffat: 90-91] « Then he turned to their gods and said, \"Do you not eat? \" » (Because the disbelievers had placed food by their idols) « What is [wrong] with you that you do not speak? \" So he proceeded to [lay] upon them a blow with [his] right hand. » [As-Saffat: 92-93] « Then [the polytheists] came toward him, hastening. » [As-Saffat: 94] « He said, \"Do you worship that which you [yourselves] carve, While Allah created you and that which you do? \" » [As-Saffat: 95-96] « They said, \"Construct for him a furnace and throw him into the blazing fire. \" » [As-Saffat: 97] « And they intended for him a plot, but We made them the lowest. » [As-Saffat: 98] « And [Abraham] said, \"Indeed, I am going to [the service of] my Lord; He will guide me. \" » [As-Saffat: 99] (Meaning: I am emigrating from the land of disbelief to the land which Allah has blessed for the worlds, and I hope that Allah (Exalted is He) will guide me to the path of goodness and what is right for my religion and my worldly life.) « My Lord, grant me [a child] from the righteous. So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy. » [As-Saffat: 100-101] « And when he reached with him [the age of] working, he said, \"O my son, indeed I have seen in a dream that I [must] sacrifice you, so see what you think. \" He said, \"O my father, do what you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, of the patient. \" » [As-Saffat: 102] « And when they had both submitted (Aslamâ) » [As-Saffat: 103] (Meaning: They submitted to the command of Allah) « and he had put him down upon his forehead, We called to him, \"O Abraham, You have fulfilled the vision. Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good. Indeed, this was the clear trial. \" And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice, And We left for him [good commendation] among later generations: \"Peace upon Abraham. \" Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good. Indeed, he was of Our believing servants. » [As-Saffat: 103-111] « And We gave him good tidings of Isaac, a prophet from among the righteous. And We blessed him and Isaac. » [As-Saffat: 112-113] There is no doubt that the context of these noble verses indicates that the one to be sacrificed was Ishmael, not Isaac, because the glad tidings of Isaac are mentioned after the glad tidings of Ishmael, who is described as a forbearing boy (Ghulâm Halîm). Isaac, when given the glad tidings, is described as a knowing boy (Ghulâm 'Alîm). Another evidence that the one to be sacrificed was Ishmael, not Isaac, is that when the glad tidings of Isaac were given, Allah said: « ...and following Isaac, Jacob (Ya'qûb). » [Hud: 71] This implies that Isaac would live and have a son during his father's lifetime. How could he be commanded to sacrifice him when he was a youth who had not yet had a child, with the certainty that he would not die until Jacob was born to him? Ibn Ishaq reported from Muhammad ibn Ka'b Al-Qurazi that he told them: \"The one whom Allah commanded Abraham to sacrifice of his two sons was Ishmael. We find that in the Book of Allah (Exalted is He). That is because when Allah (Exalted is He) finished the story of the one sacrificed from the sons of Abraham, He said: « And We gave him good tidings of Isaac, a prophet from among the righteous. » [As-Saffat: 112] And Allah (Exalted is He) says: « So We gave her good tidings of Isaac and following Isaac, Jacob. » [Hud: 71] (He says: a son and a grandson). He would not have commanded him to sacrifice Isaac when there was the promise he had been given about him. It was none other than Ishmael who was commanded to be sacrificed. \" Ibn Ishaq said: \"I heard him say that often. \" Ibn Ishaq also reported from Muhammad ibn Ka'b Al-Qurazi that he told him that he mentioned this to Umar ibn Abd Al-Aziz (may Allah be pleased with him) while he was Caliph and was with him in Ash-Sham. Umar said to him, \"This is something I had not considered, and I see it as you have said. \" Then he sent for a man who was with him in Ash-Sham, who had been a Jew and had embraced Islam and whose Islam was good, and who was considered one of their scholars. Umar ibn Abd Al-Aziz (may Allah be pleased with him) asked him about this. Muhammad ibn Ka'b said, \"I was with Umar ibn Abd Al-Aziz. \" Umar asked the man, \"Which of Abraham's two sons was commanded to be sacrificed? \" He replied, \"By Allah, O Commander of the Believers, it was Ishmael. The Jews know that, but they envy you, the Arabs, that your father (Ishmael) was the one involved in Allah's command and the virtue that Allah mentioned regarding his patience with the command. So they deny it and claim it was Isaac because Isaac is their father. \" This is not the first denial from the Jews. They denied that Abraham built the Kaaba. Knowing what the Jews would do, Allah (Exalted is He) left the Standing Place of Abraham (Maqam Ibrahim) in the Sacred House to be a witness against them until the Day of Resurrection, with knowledge of it being inherited generation after generation. Regarding this, Allah says: « Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Bakkah [Mecca] - blessed and a guidance for the worlds. In it are clear signs [such as] the standing place of Abraham (Maqam Ibrahim). » [Al 'Imran: 96-97] Until the next chapter, if Allah wills. And peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Twenty-Three: Continuation of Abraham Chapter Twenty-Three Continuation of Abraham In the previous chapter, I pointed out that Allah (Exalted is He) preserved the Standing Place of Abraham (Maqam Ibrahim) in the Sacred House to be a witness to Abraham's building of this House, knowing that the Jews would deny that Abraham was the one who built the Honored Kaaba in Mecca. He placed clear signs in it, as He says: « In it are clear signs [such as] the standing place of Abraham (Maqam Ibrahim). » [Al 'Imran: 97] And as He said: « And take, [O believers], from the standing place of Abraham (Maqam Ibrahim) a place of prayer. » [Al-Baqarah: 125] I highlighted that the Arabs have inherited the knowledge of the Standing Place of Abraham from generation to generation until the sending of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Regarding this, Abu Talib says in his famous Lamiyyah: \"And the footprint of Abraham on the rock is fresh, of his feet, barefoot and not shod. \" It is reported that a mat was spread for Abd Al-Muttalib, the grandfather of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in the shade of the Kaaba. His sons would sit around his mat until he came out to it, and none of his sons would sit on it out of reverence for him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would come when he was less than five years old, and Abd Al-Muttalib would take him and seat him on his mat. A group from Bani Madlij came performing Tawaf (circumambulation) around the Kaaba. When they saw the foot of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), they looked intently at it, then they looked intently at the Standing Place of Abraham. Then they said to Abd Al-Muttalib, \"Whose boy is this, O Sheikh? \" He said, \"This is Muhammad, my son. \" They said, \"We have never seen a foot resembling the one on the rock (Maqam Ibrahim) like the foot of your son. \" It is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described Ibrahim the Intimate Friend as the person who most resembled him. Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, while speaking about the night of his Night Journey (Isra'): \"I saw Moses, and he was a man of medium build (Darb) - meaning, not very fleshy - with smooth hair (Rajil) - meaning, his hair was well-kept and not curly - as if he was one of the men of Azd Shanu'ah. And I saw Jesus, and he was a man of medium height (Raba'ah), reddish, as if he had just come out of a bathhouse (Dîmâs). And I am the one who most resembles Abraham among his children. \" Just as Allah joined Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his father Ibrahim in physical resemblance, He also joined them in the quality of Intimate Friendship (Khullah). Allah took no intimate friend other than Muhammad and Ibrahim (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them). He also joined them in the prayer upon them, so we say in the Tashahhud: \"O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers upon Ibrahim and upon the family of Ibrahim. And send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent blessings upon Ibrahim and upon the family of Ibrahim in the worlds. Indeed, You are Praiseworthy, Glorious. \" The Jews were keen on cutting every link between the Arabs and Ishmael and Abraham, and they deleted from the Torah everything related to Ishmael after his father took him and left him and his mother in the wilderness of Paran, and they cut off all news of him after that. They were ignorant of or chose to ignore that the wilderness of Paran is the land of Mecca. Ibrahim settled in the Blessed Land of Palestine, but he continued to frequent Mecca to check on what he had left there and to perform Tawaf around the Ancient House (Al-Bayt Al-'Atiq). He supplicated for Mecca before the building of the House, saying: « My Lord, make this a secure city » [Al-Baqarah: 126] And during one of his visits to Mecca after the building of the House and the birth of Isaac, he said: « My Lord, make this city secure... » [Ibrahim: 35] Lot had suffered hardship and difficulty from his people. They called him a liar and called the Messengers liars. They committed immorality with men of the worlds. When Allah intended to destroy the people of Lot, He sent some angels to destroy them. He commanded them to pass by Ibrahim before the destruction of the towns of Lot's people to give him the glad tidings of Isaac, and following Isaac, Jacob. Allah (Exalted is He) recounted the story of the glad tidings of Isaac in several places in His Noble Book, where He says: « And already had Our messengers come to Abraham with good tidings. They said, \"Peace. \" He said, \"Peace. \" And he was not long in bringing [to them] a roasted calf. But when he saw their hands not reaching for it, he became wary of them and felt a fear of them. They said, \"Fear not. We have been sent to the people of Lot. \" And his wife was standing, and she laughed. And We gave her good tidings of Isaac and after Isaac, Jacob. She said, \"Woe to me! Will I have a child while I am an old woman and this, my husband, is an old man? Indeed, this is an amazing thing! \" They said, \"Are you amazed at the decree of Allah? May the mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you, people of the house. Indeed, He is Praiseworthy and Glorious. \" » [Hud: 69-73] And He said (Exalted is He): « And inform them about the guests of Abraham. When they entered upon him and said, \"Peace. \" He said, \"Indeed, we are fearful of you. \" They said, \"Fear not. Indeed, we give you good tidings of a knowing boy (Ghulâm ‘Alîm). \" He said, \"Have you given me good tidings when old age has touched me? Then by what [wonderous thing] do you give good tidings? \" They said, \"We have given you good tidings in truth, so do not be of the despairing. \" He said, \"And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except the astray? \" » [Al-Hijr: 51-56] And He said (Exalted is He): « And when he had isolated himself from them and from whatever they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and each [of them] We made a prophet. And We gave them of Our mercy and made for them a reputation of high honor (a lofty tongue of truth). » [Maryam: 49-50] And He said (Exalted is He): « So Lot believed in him. And [Abraham] said, \"Indeed, I will emigrate to [the service of] my Lord. Indeed, He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. \" And We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and placed in his descendants prophethood and scripture, and We gave him his reward in this world; and indeed, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous. » [Al-'Ankabut: 26-27] And He said (Exalted is He): « Has there reached you the narrative of Abraham's [heavenly] guests, the honored ones? When they entered upon him and said, \"Peace, \" he answered, \"Peace, [you are] a people unknown. \" Then he quietly went to his family and brought a fat [roasted] calf. And placed it near them. He said, \"Will you not eat? \" And he felt a fear of them. They said, \"Fear not. \" And they gave him good tidings of a knowing boy (‘Alîm). Then his wife came forward screaming and slapped her face and said, \"[I am] an old barren woman! \" They said, \"Thus has said your Lord. Indeed, He is the Wise, the Knowing. \" » [Adh-Dhariyat: 24-30] The Noble Qur'an explicitly states that Jacob was the son of Isaac, where Allah says: « Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob, when he said to his sons, \"What will you worship after me? \" They said, \"We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac - one God. And we are in submission to Him. \" » [Al-Baqarah: 133] (Abraham is the grandfather, Ishmael is the uncle, and Isaac is the father, and all are referred to as 'fathers'). Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, described Abraham with [various] qualities, saying: « Indeed, Abraham was a [single] nation, obedient to Allah, inclining toward truth (Hanîf) » [An-Nahl: 120] And He said: « Indeed, Abraham was one who was ever supplicating (Awwâh) and forbearing (Halîm). » [At-Tawbah: 114] And He said: « And Allah took Abraham as an intimate friend (Khalîl). » [An-Nisa: 125] As for what Allah recounted concerning Abraham in His saying: « And [mention] when Abraham said, \"My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead. \" [Allah] said, \"Have you not believed? \" He said, \"Yes, but [I ask] only that my heart may be satisfied. \" [Allah] said, \"Take four of the birds and draw them toward you. Then put on every hill a portion of them. Then call them; they will come to you in haste. And know that Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. \" » [Al-Baqarah: 260] This is explicit that when Abraham asked, he was certain of the Resurrection and of Allah's ability to bring the dead back to life, but he wanted to add the evidence of certainty ('Ayn Al-Yaqîn) to the knowledge of certainty ('Ilm Al-Yaqîn), and for this to be one of the perceptible, material proofs of Allah's ability to bring the dead back to life. Allah has recounted...\" Stories of the Prophets: The True Narrative 3.1 In Sūrat Al-Baqarah (The Cow), the Most High mentions a set of examples concerning this. He mentions the story of the man killed among the Children of Israel and striking him with a part of the slaughtered cow, and He said: $Thus does Allah bring the dead to life and show you His signs that you might reason.$ [Al-Baqarah: 73]. And He said: $And [recall] when you said, «O Moses, we will not believe you until we see Allah outright»; so the thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on. Then We resurrected you after your death that you might be grateful.$ [Al-Baqarah: 55-56]. And He said: $Have you not considered those who left their homes in thousands, fearing death? Allah said to them, «Die»; then He restored them to life. Indeed, Allah is a Possessor of bounty for the people, but most of the people do not show gratitude.$ [Al-Baqarah: 243]. And He said: $Or [consider] the one who passed by a town while it was a ruin over its roofless walls. He said, «How will Allah bring this back to life after its death?» So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years; then He revived him. He said, «How long have you remained?» He said, «I have remained a day or part of a day.» He said, «Rather, you have remained one hundred years. Look at your food and your drink; it has not changed. And look at your donkey. And [We did this] that We might make you a sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and then clothe them with flesh.» When it became clear to him, he said, «I know that Allah is over all things competent.»$ [Al-Baqarah: 259]. Immediately after this story, He quotes the saying of Abraham: $My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead.$ [Al-Baqarah: 260]. As for what Al-Bukhari narrated in his Ṣaḥīḥ from the Hadith of Abū Hurayrah, that the Messenger of Allah said: “We are more entitled to doubt than Abraham when he said: $My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead.$ [Allah] said: «Do you not believe?» He said: «Yes, but that my heart may be satisfied.»” [Al-Baqarah: 260]. May Allah have mercy on Lot! He indeed sought refuge in a strong support. And had I remained in prison for as long as Joseph remained, I would have answered the caller. The purpose of this is to praise these three Prophets and to show the loftiness of their status. If Abraham had been in doubt, I would have been more deserving of doubt than him. And since it has not crossed anyone's mind that Muhammad doubts Allah's power to revive the dead, the same applies to Abraham. This is one of the well-known rhetorical styles, known as ‘Confirming the Praise by what Resembles a Censure’ (Ta’kīd al-Madḥ bi-mā yushbihu al-Dhamm). The 'strong support' (Rukn Shadīd) in which Lot sought refuge is Allah, the Blessed and Most High. His saying in the verse: $...or seek refuge in a strong support.$ [Hūd: 80]. The word ‘or’ (aw) here means 'but' (bal), i.e., 'but I seek refuge in Allah'. Then follows the praise of Joseph for preserving himself from evil despite the harm and imprisonment he endured. And the saying of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him: “Had I remained in prison for as long as Joseph remained, I would have answered the caller,” meaning, I would have hastened to respond to what the King's messenger called me to and would have left the prison. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ intended to draw attention to the high status attained by Joseph the Truthful (Aṣ-Ṣiddīq). Until the next chapter, God willing, and may the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Chapter Twenty-Four Continuation on Abraham Stories of the Prophets: The True Narrative In the previous chapter, I referred to what Allah, the Blessed and Most High, recounted about Abraham, from his saying: $My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead$ ...to the end of the verse [Al-Baqarah: 260]. I explained the meaning of the Messenger of Allah’s statement: “We are more entitled to doubt than Abraham,” and clarified that what came from Abraham was not doubt, and that the intention of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was to praise Abraham and show the loftiness of his rank. I also explained that this came in the manner of the rhetorical style known as ‘Confirming the Praise by what Resembles a Censure’ (Ta’kīd al-Madḥ bi-mā yushbihu al-Dhamm), like the saying of the poet: “They have no fault except that their swords bear nicks from clashing against the battalions.” Allah commanded His Prophet to follow the example of Abraham. Concerning this: $Say, «Indeed, my Lord has guided me to a straight path—a religion of correctness—the creed of Abraham, inclining toward truth, and he was not of the polytheists.» Say, «Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds. No partner has He. And this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.»$ [Al-An'ām: 161-163]. He refuted the claim of the Jews and Christians that they loved Abraham and were upon his religion, saying: $Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to Allah]. And he was not of the polytheists. Indeed, the most deserving of Abraham among the people are those who followed him [in his lifetime] and this Prophet [Muhammad] and those who have believed. And Allah is the protector of the believers.$ [Āl 'Imrān: 67-68]. And He said: $O People of the Scripture, why do you dispute about Abraham while the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him? Then will you not reason?$ [Āl 'Imrān: 65]. And the Most High said: $And who would abandon the religion of Abraham except one who is foolish in mind? And We had chosen him in this world, and indeed, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous. When his Lord said to him, «Submit,» he said, «I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds.» And Abraham instructed his sons [to do the same] and [likewise] Jacob, [saying], «O my sons, indeed Allah has chosen for you this religion, so do not die except as Muslims.»$ [Al-Baqarah: 130-132]. Allah the Most High described Abraham as 'one who fulfilled' (waffā), meaning he completed everything Allah commanded him to do. Concerning this, He says: $...and [of] Abraham, who fulfilled [his obligations].$ [An-Najm: 37]. And He says: $And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham was tried by his Lord with commands and he fulfilled them. [Allah] said, «Indeed, I will make you a leader for the people.» [Abraham] said, «And [make leaders] from my offspring?» [Allah] said, «My covenant does not reach the wrongdoers.»$ [Al-Baqarah: 124]. And as He said: $Indeed, Abraham was a [single] nation, obedient to Allah, inclining toward truth, and he was not of the polytheists. [He was] grateful for His favors; Allah chose him and guided him to a straight path. And We gave him good in this world, and indeed, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous. Then We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth; and he was not of the polytheists.$ [An-Naḥl: 120-123]. The polytheists used to claim that they were upon the religion of Abraham. They had painted images of Abraham and Ishmael and hung their images in the Kaaba with divining arrows (Azlām) in their hands, using them to seek omens. The Messenger of Allah swore that they never sought omens with the divining arrows, and he ordered the images to be erased. Al-Bukhari narrated in his Ṣaḥīḥ from the Hadith of Ibn 'Abbās that when the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, saw the images in the House, he did not enter until he ordered them to be erased. He saw Abraham and Ishmael with divining arrows in their hands and said: “May Allah fight them! By Allah, they never sought omens with the divining arrows.” In some of Al-Bukhari's narrations of this Hadith, he said: “May Allah fight them! They knew well that our ancestor never sought omens with them.” Allah the Most High took none of His creation as intimate friends (Khalīlayn) except Abraham and Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them both). It is established in the two Ṣaḥīḥs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the Hadith of Jundub Al-Bajali, 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, and Ibn Mas'ūd, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “O people, indeed Allah has taken me as an intimate friend (Khalīl).” Al-Bukhari also reported from the Hadith of Abū Sa'īd that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said in his last sermon: “O people, if I were to take an intimate friend (Khalīl) from the inhabitants of the earth, I would take Abū Bakr as an intimate friend, but your companion is the Intimate Friend (Khalīl) of Allah.” Al-Bukhari also reported in his Ṣaḥīḥ from the Hadith of 'Amr ibn Maymūn, who said: When Mu'ādh arrived in Yemen, he led them in the morning prayer and recited: $...and Allah took Abraham as an intimate friend.$ [An-Nisā: 125]. A man among the people said: “The eye of Abraham’s mother has been comforted.” Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported from the Hadith of Abū Hurayrah, who said: It was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, who is the most honorable of people?” He said: “The most honorable of them is the most righteous of them.” They said: “That is not what we ask you about.” He said: “Then the most honorable of people is Joseph, the Prophet of Allah, the son of the Prophet of Allah, the son of the Prophet of Allah, the son of the Intimate Friend of Allah (Abraham).” They said: “That is not what we ask you about.” He said: “Then you are asking me about the origins of the Arabs?” They said: “Yes.” He said: “The best of them in the time of ignorance (Jāhiliyyah) are the best of them in Islam, if they attain understanding of the religion (fiqh).” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, informed that Abraham, the Intimate Friend of the Most Gracious (Khalīl Ar-Raḥmān), will be the first person to be clothed on the Day of Resurrection. Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported from the Hadith of Ibn 'Abbās, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “The people will be gathered naked, uncircumcised. The first to be clothed will be Abraham.” Then he recited: $...As We began the first creation, We will repeat it.$ [Al-Anbiyā: 104]. And Allah the Most High made it part of Abraham's reward for building the Sacred Kaaba that He placed him leaning his back against the Bayt Al-Ma'mūr (the Frequented House) in the Seventh Heaven. This is mentioned in Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhari in the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, concerning the Night Journey (Isrā'), where he said: “Then we came to the Seventh Heaven. It was said: ‘Who is this?’ It was said: ‘Gabriel.’ It was said: ‘And who is with you?’ It was said: ‘Muhammad.’ It was said: ‘Has he been sent for?’ ‘Welcome to him, and what an excellent coming he has!’ Then I came to Abraham and greeted him. He said: ‘Welcome to you, my son and Prophet.’ In one narration: ‘Welcome to the righteous son and the righteous Prophet.’ And behold, he—meaning Abraham—was leaning his back against the Bayt Al-Ma'mūr, and seventy thousand angels enter it every day, never to return to it.” Despite this honor and high status of Abraham, the Intimate Friend of the Most Gracious, he could not benefit his father, who died in polytheism (Shirk). Al-Bukhari reported in his Ṣaḥīḥ from the Hadith of Abū Hurayrah that the Prophet ﷺ said: “Abraham will meet his father Azar on the Day of Resurrection, and over Azar's face will be dust and darkness. Abraham will say to him: ‘Did I not tell you not to disobey me?’ His father will say to him: ‘Today, I will not disobey you.’ Abraham will say: ‘O Lord, You promised me that You would not disgrace me on the Day they are resurrected. What disgrace is greater than my farthest father?’ Allah the Most High will say: ‘Indeed, I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.’” Then it will be said: “O Abraham! What is beneath your feet?” He will look and see a filthy, smeared hyena, which will be seized by its legs and thrown into the Fire. This is in line with what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “O Fāṭima, daughter of Muhammad, ask me for whatever you wish from my property, for I cannot avail you against Allah at all. And O 'Abbās, uncle of the Prophet, save your own soul, I cannot avail you against Allah at all.” And as He said to him: $Indeed, you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided.$ [Al-Qaṣaṣ: 56]. And when the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said after the death of Abū Ṭālib: “I will ask for forgiveness for you as long as I am not forbidden to do so,” Allah revealed: $It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the Hellfire. And the request for forgiveness of Abraham for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he disassociated himself from him. Indeed, Abraham was one who frequently invoked [Allah] and was forbearing.$ [At-Tawbah: 113-114]. I have chosen to mention that Allah the Blessed and Most High brought together Abraham and Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them both) in their physical and moral attributes. Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the person who most resembled his father Abraham (peace and blessings be upon them both). Al-Bukhari reported from the Hadith of Ibn 'Abbās, who said: “$Sufficient for us is Allah, and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs.$ [Āl 'Imrān: 173] was said by Abraham when he was thrown into the fire. And it was said by Muhammad when it was said to him: $Indeed, the people have gathered against you, so fear them. But it [merely] increased them in faith, and they said, «Sufficient for us is Allah, and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs.» So they returned with favor from Allah and bounty, no harm having touched them. And they pursued the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is the Possessor of great bounty.$ [Āl 'Imrān: 173-174]. Al-Bukhari also reported in his Ṣaḥīḥ from the Hadith of Ibn 'Abbās, who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to seek protection for Al-Ḥasan and Al-Ḥusayn and would say: “Indeed, your father (Abraham) used to seek protection for Ishmael and Isaac with it: $I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from every devil and every harmful pest, and from every evil eye.$” Allah confined the Prophethood and the Book to the descendants of Abraham after him, as He says: $And We had already sent Noah and Abraham and placed in their descendants prophethood and the Scripture.$ [Al-Ḥadīd: 26]. And as He said: $And We gave him Isaac and Jacob and placed in his descendants prophethood and the Scripture.$ [Al-'Ankabūt: 27]. Thus, every Book that Allah the Most High revealed to a Prophet after Abraham was in his descendants. From Isaac was born Jacob, who is Israel, and to him all their tribes (Asbāṭ) trace their lineage. Prophethood remained among them until it was sealed with Jesus, son of Mary, who is from the Children of Israel through his mother's lineage. As for the second branch of Abraham's progeny, it is Ishmael. And from his progeny came the Seal of the Prophets and the Master of the Messengers, who is the dazzling Jewel and the brilliant Pearl, and he is the possessor of the Praised Station (Maqām Maḥmūd) and the Visited Basin (Ḥawḍ Mawrūd) which the first and the last will envy on the Day of Resurrection. It is established in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, that he said: “I will stand at a station that all creatures will desire, even Abraham.” Until the next chapter, God willing, and may the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.",
